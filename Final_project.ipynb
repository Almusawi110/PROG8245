    "## Introduction:\n",
    "In this project, we will develop an interactive chatbot designed to facilitate real-time communication, tackling the complexities of natural language understanding. At the core of the project will be the deployment of a machine learning model that classifies user queries into distinct categories, utilizing advanced data preprocessing methods to enhance input interpretation. By incorporating a library of response templates, the chatbot will dynamically generate pertinent replies, providing users with an intuitive and responsive conversational experience. This system will not only embody the intricacies of language processing but also showcase the seamless integration of AI into user-centric applications.<br>\n",
    "### Topic:<br>\n",
    "The project aims to create a chatbot specifically designed to assist the deaf community, particularly families with deaf children, by making it easier to learn sign language. This chatbot will serve as a virtual assistant, offering guidance, resources, and support to help users navigate daily challenges more effectively. Through interactive learning modules and easy-to-access information, the chatbot will simplify the process of learning sign language, making everyday communication more accessible and enhancing the quality of life for those in the deaf community"

    "## Feature Extraction :\n",
    "For feature extraction I will choose three distinct methods of text representation—TF-IDF, GloVe, and GPT which can cover a broad spectrum of natural language processing capabilities. Here’s a brief introduction to why these three methods are particularly suitable:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)\n",
    "TF-IDF is a statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word to a document in a collection or corpus. It provides a weight to each word which signifies the relevance of the word for a particular document. The rationale for using TF-IDF for text analysis is its effectiveness in filtering out common words that are frequently used across all documents but hold little meaning in distinguishing a document in a given corpus. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation)\n",
    "GloVe is an unsupervised learning algorithm for generating vector representations for words. Training is performed on aggregated global word-word co-occurrence statistics from a corpus, and the resulting representations showcase interesting linear substructures of the word vector space. Choosing GloVe is beneficial for text analysis because it captures both the semantic and syntactic aspects of words. This can enhance performance in tasks like thematic similarity detection, where context and the relational meaning of words are crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)\n",
    "GPT, developed by OpenAI, is a state-of-the-art language model that uses the transformer architecture. It is pre-trained on a large corpus and fine-tuned for specific tasks. For chatbot Q/A, GPT can be particularly useful due to its ability to understand and generate human-like text. This capability makes it ideal for tasks that require a deep understanding of language, such as generating contextual responses or enhancing language-based data augmentation strategies for other learning models in social media analysis."

    "\n",
    "1969: This number indicates that the large text string has been successfully segmented into 1,969 separate sentences. Each of these sentences will be treated as an individual document by the TF-IDF model.\n",
    "\n",
    "<class 'str'>: Each element in the list is a string, which is the required format for each document (or sentence in this case) when using TfidfVectorizer."

The performance of the model is assessed by comparing predictions to actual values, calculating accuracy, and displaying a confusion matrix. Additionally, the trained classifier and the label encoder are saved to disk using joblib for future use, allowing model reusability without retraining."

Under the hood, it leverages a pre-trained model for processing natural language, which has been fine-tuned to understand and classify user input effectively. The chatbot utilizes advanced preprocessing techniques to ensure that the input data is in the optimal form for the model to interpret. Upon receiving a query, the model predicts a category, and the chatbot then selects a suitable response from a set of predefined templates corresponding to that category, providing users with informative and contextually relevant answers."

    "The ChatbotGUI class is designed to handle everything related to the chatbot interface and interactions within a Tkinter window. The major components and their purposes are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initialization Method (__init__):**<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: Sets up the chatbot environment including loading necessary models, defining the response templates, and initializing the GUI setup.\n",
    "Components:\n",
    "self.root: The main window of the application, passed as an argument.\n",
    "self.tfidf_vectorizer and self.svm_model: These are loaded from disk using joblib.load(), ensuring that the vectorizer and model used during interaction are the same ones used during the model’s training.\n",
    "self.response_templates: A dictionary mapping numerical labels to human-readable text that will be used as responses in the chat.\n",
    "**GUI Setup Method (setup_gui):**<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: Constructs the GUI layout, including creating and placing a text box for the chat log, an entry field for user input, and a send button.\n",
    "Components:\n",
    "self.chat_log: A scrolledtext.ScrolledText widget that displays the conversation. It is initially set to 'disabled' to prevent direct editing.\n",
    "self.message_entry: A tk.Entry widget where users type their messages.\n",
    "send_button: A tk.Button that triggers the send_message method when clicked.<br>\n",
    "**Response Generation Method (get_chatbot_response):**<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: Processes user input to generate a chatbot response using the preloaded SVM model and TF-IDF vectorizer.\n",
    "Process:\n",
    "The input text is transformed to its TF-IDF representation and passed to the SVM model to predict a label.\n",
    "The predicted label is used to fetch an appropriate response from self.response_templates.\n",
    "Error handling is incorporated to manage exceptions during vectorization or prediction, improving the robustness of the application.\n",
    "**Message Handling Method (send_message):**<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: Manages sending of messages. It updates the chat log with user inputs and chatbot responses.\n",
    "Process:\n",
    "Retrieves user input from self.message_entry.\n",
    "Updates self.chat_log with the user’s message.\n",
    "Calls get_chatbot_response to fetch the bot’s reply and updates the chat log with this response.\n",
    "Clears the entry widget for the next input and disables editing of the chat log to maintain integrity.\n",
    "**Main Function (main)**<br>\n",
    "Purpose: Initializes the main application window and starts the Tkinter main loop.\n",
    "Functionality: Creates a Tkinter root window, instantiates the ChatbotGUI class with this root, and runs the Tkinter event loop, which waits for events such as button clicks and handles them as defined."
