    "The Universal POS Tagset, as the name suggests, aims to be more universal and less language-dependent. It reduces the number of tags compared to the Penn Treebank Tagset, making it simpler and easier to use across different languages. It includes tags such as NOUN, VERB, ADJ, and others.<br>\n",

    "4. WordNet POS Tagset:<br>\n",
    "WordNet is a lexical database that categorizes words into sets of synonyms called synsets. The WordNet POS Tagset is used to represent the POS of a word in WordNet. It includes tags like NOUN, VERB, ADJ, ADV, and others.<br>"
