Children need a way to communicate to control their environment and to ease frustration.,learning sign language
They need to make choices and have some power in order to develop independence.,learning sign language

"Why arent we, the DHHDB community, writing our own stories?",stories
The answer is complicated.,identities of deaf
"American Sign Language (ASL) has a rich tradition of storytelling, but its a visual language with no written equivalent.",stories

2016 FUN BILINGUAL -BIMODAL EBOOKS FOR DEAF CHILDREN : DEVELOPING LANGUAGE AND PRELITERACY SKILLS EBOOKS BIMODAIS DIVERTIDOS PARA C RIANAS SURDAS: DESENVOLVENDO A LINGUAGEM E HABILIDADES DE PR-ALFABETIZAO DIVERTIDOS LIBROS ELECTRNICOS BIMODALES BILNGES PARA NIOS SORDOS: DESARROLLANDO LA LENGUA Y LA HABILIDAD DE PRE -ESCRITA Donna Jo Napoli Eugene R. Mirus Abstract Ebooks provide new ways to advance developing literacy among deaf children.,learning sign language
"While some aim to promote literacy through explicit pedagogical techniques, the new ebooks described here aim only to offer stories that are fun to share, encouraging learning through interaction that naturally fosters language and preliter acy skills.",stories
Reading for pleasure is recognized as valuable for hearing children; it needs to be recognized as such for deaf children.,stories
"We present the rationale for these ebooks and give examples of how they advance preliteracy skills, in the hopes that those raising and educating deaf children will use them, offered gratis on the Internet.",stories
"Keywords: deaf children, literacy, ebooks, shared reading activities Introduction This paper describes ebooks of a new sort , which are offered gratis on the Internet .",stories
"They are intended to promote language skills in deaf children, leading to overall better skills, at home and at school .",learning sign language
Most of the attention with regard to literacy in deaf children is focused on print -literacy skills.,identities of deaf
"However, these ebooks also introd uce children to the mechanisms used in storytelling among the deaf, thus they promote sign -literacy skills, as well.",learning sign language

"2016 Background The new ebooks are founded on three propositions : fun is essential to learning, deaf childrens academic achievements depend largely on a firm foundation in a first language, and shared reading activities (SRAs) can be fun events that help develop a first language.",learning sign language
"First, play is a major wa y children learn ( KUSCHNER , 2008) , allowing connections critical to reading (G AMBRELL , 2011) and math (MURAYAM A, et al.",learning sign language
", 2013).",identities of deaf
"It promotes health ( ALEXANDER, FROHLICH, & FUSCO , 2014), ethical development (E DMISTON , 2007), and lifelong happiness (M ARTIN , 2014).",stories
"Deaf p reschool ers need to explore the wo rld through play, nourishing cognitive faculties their plastic brains are prime d to develop , like language (HUMPHRIES , et al.",learning sign language
", 2012) .",identities of deaf
"Second, deaf chi ldren are at risk academically ( EASTERBROOKS , et al., 2015 ), and most point to lack of a solid language foundation (LEDERBERG, SCHICK, & SPENCER , 2013).",learning sign language
O ften deaf children are raised strictly orally; but the auditory information they receive may not prov ide language access .,identities of deaf
"A bilingual approach has a better chance of protecting academic success since exposure to an accessible language is the key to developing native -like proficiency in any language, and a solid first language foundation is also critical for the successful acquisition of a second language ( MOUNTY, PUCCI, & HARMON, 2014, p. 334).",learning sign language
"Regardless of their speech skills, d eaf children who s ign do better academically (MAYBERRY, DEL GIUDICE, & LIEBERMAN, 2011) in reading (F REEL , et al.",learning sign language
", 2011) and writing (B ASHA , 2014) , whether their parents are deaf or hearing (H ASSANZADEH , 2012) , although socio -demographic factors play a secondary role (S COTT , 2015) .",learning sign language
"Third, we accept the conclusion of the 1985 National Academy of Education Commission on Reading: The single most important activity for building the knowledge required for eventual success in reading is reading aloud to children (A NDERSON , et al.",learning sign language
", 1985, p. 23).",None
"While much research before and after has focused on monolingual hearing children, the conclusion holds for multilingual ( KALIA, 2007) and deaf ( WILLIAMS, 2004) children , too .",identities of deaf
"Thus, we interpret the 1985 conclusion to mean that shared reading activities (SR As) are fundamental to reading in mon o- and multilingual contexts whether speech is involved or not .",learning sign language
"Bilingual books in SRAs are used to enh ance print literacy around the world (SEMINGSON , POLE , & T OMMERDAHL , 2015).",learning sign language
"SRAs in crease vocabular y and teach narrative skills, 154 Revi sta Sinalizar, v.1, n.2, p. 152 -178, jul./dez.",learning sign language
"2016 particularly when adult -child interaction involves higher level facilitative language technique s (TRIVETTE , DUNST, & GORMAN , 2010).",learning sign language
"W hen adults ask open -ended questions about story comprehen sion then give the child time to consider and formulate an answer, the childs preparatory skills for print literacy grow (P ETERS , 2015) , including the ability to engage in inferencing (V AN KLEECK , 2008) .Further, the benefit in SRAs lies in fun throug h interaction , not through explicit pedagogi cal behavior , that is, in simply talking about the written text (hereafter referred to simply as text) (WHITEHURST , & ZEVENBERGEN , 2003).",stories
"Many promote p edagogical SRAs for deaf chil dren, with guidelines for the parents, telling them to point to text words , fingers pell them, and sometimes even give a simple linguistic analysis of them (such as the NSF Science of Learning Center on Visual Language and Visual Learnin g (VL2) at Gallaudet University, which produces ebooks; see NAPOLI, & MIRUS, 2015).",learning sign language
"Often pedagogical SRAs focus on dialogic reading, where the parent prompts the child s response, evaluates it , expands on it, then guides the child to repeat it (FUNG, CHOW , MCBRIDE -CHANG , 2005).",learning sign language
Such SRAs are lesson s generally recommend ed for children over five.,learning sign language
What about younger children?,learning sign language
"SRAs are crucial for them (MOL, & BUS , 2011 ) and ebooks for deaf preschoolers must hold their attention .",stories
"Once the deaf childs attention strays , she is no longer receiving the book.",stories
"A hearing child cannot decide not to hear; even if her attention str ays, she is still exposed to the book .",learning sign language
Not so for the deaf child ; so fun is paramount.,identities of deaf
"For the past two decades, education scholars have shown that early cognitive work marks the emergent print literacy period (MAYER , & T REZEK , 2015) .",learning sign language
"Included in that work must be firm first language acquisi tion (BECK , & O LAH , 2001) with extensive skills in vocabulary, syntax, and discourse (D ICKINSON , MCCABE , & E SSEX , 2006) , allowing the chi ld complex interactions with capable users of the language (M AYER , & W ELLS , 1996), as well as use of language to communicate with oneself, thus transforming thought into language (W ATSON, 2001) .",learning sign language
"The distinc tion between outside -in and inside -out information (WHITEHURST , & LONIGAN , 1998) in acquiring literacy is well accepted .",learning sign language
"Outside -in information includes language development , story structure, and conceptua l knowledge associated with comprehension , but not necessarily tied to text.",learning sign language
Inside -out information includes phonological and letter knowledge closely tied to text.,learning sign language
"While much research in deaf print literacy concerns inside -out skills and focu ses on the child 5 and older , outside -in skills are foundational: 155 Revi sta Sinalizar, v.1, n.2, p. 152 -178, jul./dez.",identities of deaf
2016 inside -out skills allow one to translate print into words; outside -in skills allow one to understand what those words mean.,learning sign language
"Both are essential to reading, where outside -in skills are a critical step in learning to read for meaning (WHITEHURST , & L ONIGAN , 2001, p. 14).",learning sign language
"The ebooks here aim to encourage activities that p romote outside -in information in that they advance knowledge of a sign language, facilitate metalinguistic development, promote understanding of narratives, and introduce cultural kn owledg e necessary for understand ing texts.",learning sign language
"For example, a Christmas story informs about Santa Claus and his reindeer, putting the child in a better position to read texts about Christmas traditions.",stories
"We conclude that SRAs develop skills necessary for print literacy through extensive playful language interaction ( DECKNER , ADAMSON , & BAKEMAN , 2006).",learning sign language
"Even for older children, the key to improved reading is the joy of getting lost in a narrative or being thrilled by discovery in nonfiction.",stories
"Thats what makes the hard job of learning to read worth it (WILLINGHAM , 2015, p. 182).",learning sign language
"But hearing parents do not often engage in SRAs with their deaf children (E WOLDT , 1986) and, if they do, its typically not a pleasurable experience (SCHLEPER , 1995).",identities of deaf
This needs to change.,learning sign language
SRAs for deaf c hildren Our areas of expertise led us to try to contribute toward the language development and education of deaf children by providing materials for fun SRAs.,learning sign language
"We are linguists; one of us writes childrens books; one of us is a former actor in the National Theater of the Deaf , being a deaf native signer of ASL .",identities of deaf
"With our students, we produce bilingu al-bimodal ebooks for SRAs .",learning sign language
"The ebooks have illustrations and text , plus videos in a sign language .",learning sign language
"Ebooks with a sign narrator have been shown to increase the amount of time that families with deaf children spend in SRAs, a nontrivial result since longer exposure positively impact s language and print literacy development (M UELLER , & H URTIG , 2010 ).",learning sign language
"Most of our ebooks are English/ASL ; others are English/ IrishSL, Korean/KSL , Brazilian Portuguese/ Libr as, Nepali/ NSL , and English/ Fiji SL.",learning sign language
"As of August 2015, we have produced 16, but more are in production, including Japanese/Nihon Shuwa, Greek/Greek Sign Language, and Italian/LIS.",learning sign language
"The ebooks help with language interaction by providing good sign lan guage models for the family, for without a common language , the deaf child will be left out.",learning sign language
"That fact needs to be 156 Revi sta Sinalizar, v.1, n.2, p. 152 -178, jul./dez.",identities of deaf
"2016 stressed: rich manual language exchanges with their mothers, in particular, are critical to the academic success of deaf children (CALDERON, 2000).",learning sign language
"The videos in these new ebooks promote language lea rning through contextual cues (CHALHOUB -DEVILLE , 2003), integration of visual and linguistic information (TANENHAUS , et al.",learning sign language
", 1995), and a reliance on world knowledge (CHAMBERS , et al., 2002).",identities of deaf
Hearing family members can also use the text when learning to sign.,learning sign language
"The language support here is somewhat similar to that in multimedia stories for multilingual hearing children, su ch as the books created with Fabula software and used across Europe (EDWARDS , MONAGHAN , & K NIGHT , 2000) .",stories
"Fabula books are intended to support, among others, the child whose home language is a mino rity (often endangered) which differs from the school language (such as Welsh -English, or Basque -Spanish) .",stories
"The books are read on the computer, with texts in both home and school language s. Children can click on a speaker button to hear the text read in both languages.",stories
Researchers have found several advantages.,learning sign language
"First, the minority -speaking child find s support in scaffolding from reading skills (especially comprehension) in the home language to the school language.",learning sign language
"Second, the parent who speaks the minority language but doesnt read the school language can now share books with the child, and can use those books to improve their own use of the school language.",learning sign language
"Third, the majority -speaking child, who is often monolingual, becomes more aware of languag e issues in general.",learning sign language
"Similar advantages have been found in America with computer -based books using audio and video (SKOUGE , RAO, & B OISVERT, 2007).",stories
"And, on point, in a study of bilingual -bimodal ebooks with a signing narrator where hearing parents were trained on how to use the ebooks with their deaf children, even parents who were noncompliant and did not underg o the parent training learned many signs purely from watching the sign narrato r (MUELLER , & H URTIG , 2010 ).",learning sign language
"Finally, the ability to review the vi deos promotes an analytical approach to both language and story (KRENTZ , 2006).",stories
"The interaction of adult and child ren SRAs should help develop language and understanding of characterization and narrative, and establis h a love of liter ature .",learning sign language
"The nitty gritty: Selecting sources and making the ebooks We have no funding, so all books we use as a basis for producing ebook s must be in the public domain or the copyright holders must grant us their kind permission.",stories
"Deaf children (and 157 Revi sta Sinalizar, v.1, n.2, p. 152 -178, jul./dez.",identities of deaf
"2016 their parents) deserve hi gh quality reading materials, which we hope to guarantee by using standardly published books or books offered on the Internet that our students unanimously agree upon and that we test on hearing children before deciding to go forth with them.",stories
"Within those limitati ons, we choose stories based on clear criteria.",stories
"All must be visually rich and relatable to deaf childrens life experience s, to provide a welcome into reading (DENNIS , LYNCH , & S TOCKALL , 2012).",identities of deaf
"For example, a book about taking a walk at night with a father and hearing an owl hoot can create a magical feeling in a hearing child but leave a deaf child baffled.",stories
"Our books deal with ordinary events like birthday pa rties (in KEVINS BIRTHDAY), as well as extraordinary but visually exciting and easily comprehensible events like a runaway baby carriage ( in THE SLANT BOOK).",stories
"In some a non -human character presents the story from a minority viewpoint, allowing de af children to identify.",identities of deaf
O ne is about a dog w ho moves to a house full of cats (in ROCKY THE C AT WHO BARKS); another is about an egg that goes hard -boiled and bounces away rather than allowing himself to get cracked ( in HUMPTY DUMPTY).,stories
"In one a character faces huge challenges , but with self -confidence and hard work, they are met a reassuring narrative (in THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD).",stories
Some introduce classics that are part of the American heritage (such as TWAS THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS and JEMIMA PUDDLE DUCK).,stories
"Four are no nfiction (produced with the kind permission of National Geographic), one relatable to the childs life ( in HALLOWEEN), two presenting information preschoolers are general ly held responsible for, metamorphosis and knowledge of African animals ( in CATERPILLA R TO BUTTERFLY and in SAFARI), and one presenting just plain old fun information for any child ( in RACE DAY).",stories
"Most t hus far target the 3 and 4 year old , but a few are for toddlers .",stories
"Once weve chosen a book, our students take over and we serve as sounding boards and guides .",stories
"Half our students are at Gallaude t University and the other half, at Swarthmore College.",learning sign language

"All give feedback on acting, editin g, and production .",stories
"All ebooks for deaf children (not just ours) use storytelling techniques of sign literature : the visual vernacular (R IGGS , 2003 ), thus developing sign -literacy skills in the readers.",stories
"These 158 Revi sta Sinalizar, v.1, n.2, p. 152 -178, jul./dez.",stories
"2016 techniques lack counterpart s in writing, although texts can approximate : ALL CAPITALS for loudness, italics for emphasis, arrangement of letters to indicat e s l o w action .",learning sign language
"However, visual -vernacular techniques have spoken counterparts in the form of voice alterations (GREENE BRABHAM , & L YNCH -BROWN , 2002) .",identities of deaf
"Certain visual -vernacular techniques give the deaf child advantages analogous to advantages reading aloud gives the hearing child (NAPOLI , & M IRUS , 2015 ).",learning sign language
One such technique is varying motion speed (support for narrative changes).,learning sign language
"Another is varying shot di stance , for example, showing a ho rse up close by letting the fists become the hooves, or at middle -range by le tting the nondominant hand become the horse while the dominant hand is a rider on the horse, or at a distance by having the two index fingers brush past each other like horses in a race seen from the stands (help in interpret ing how illustrations relate to plot).",learning sign language
"A third is role shift , whereby the signer embodies one charac ter, then shifts (torso, head , or gaze) to embody another character (help in understanding ch aracterization and develop ing Theory of Mind see S CHICK , et al.",learning sign language
", 2007 ).",Caring for the Deaf Patient
"But there is a critical way our ebooks differ from others: we encourage our signers to read the story, let it roll a round in their minds , then tell it without attemp ting to translate, in a way natural for them.",stories
"They practice to each other and to deaf people outside class , including children.",learning sign language
"Final versions tend to integrate information fro m text and illustrations, and even new information that the class agrees fits (we discuss an example of th is below).",learning sign language
"This kind of freedom respects the signers creativity and has led to excellent language modeling and, we believe, more fun.",learning sign language
"With regard to language modeling, generally sign performers set the scene by using signs to present an essentially static image before creating movin g characters (S UTTON -SPENCE , & KANEKO , 2016 , p. 168).",learning sign language
"Strict adherence to a text, in contrast , can result in grammatical but atypical signing.",learning sign language

Analysis of the new ebooks We here describe how the new ebooks can help by offering discussion of one : TWAS THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42nXcSIebPE .,stories
This is representative of our ebooks for the older preschooler .,stories
"Since it is a classic tale, we do not give the entire text, but simply zoom in on specific points.",stories
"The signer , Caleb Joshua Smith, has given us his permission to discuss every aspect of his work .",identities of deaf
Many of the decisions concerning how he would sign were made collaboratively with class members .,learning sign language
Overall organization of original text and of sign r endering This text consists of 28 rhyming couplets.,learning sign language
The spoken rhyme is tyrannical with respect to organization of the text.,learning sign language
"First, it ignores change of focus, as seen in this example: He had a broad face and a little round belly, / that shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly.",learning sign language
"He was chubby an d plump, a right jolly old elf,/ and I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself.",stories
"The first three lines concern the appea rance of Santa; the fourth, the narrators reaction .",stories
But rhyme forces couplets.,stories
"The book designer, however, laid out the text across three pages of the original storybook: He had a broad face and a little round belly, That shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly.",stories
"160 Revi sta Sinalizar, v.1, n.2, p. 152 -178, jul./dez.",learning sign language
"2016 He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf, And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself.",stories
Here the layout does not respect the couplet structure; the second page straddles two couplets.,stories
"Our signer, in comparison , produced 37 video clips overall , whe re most clips corresponded to a page of text, but several times two clips correspond ed to a page .",learning sign language
"He grouped these four lines (that is, the two couplets) above as follows , where numbers indicate the minute and second clips begin and e nd in the YouTube video that you can watch : 4:08-4:12 He had a broad face and a little round belly , 4:13-4:18 that shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly.",learning sign language
"He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf, 4:19-4:26 and I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself.",stories
"Thus there are three clips, rather than two couplets; the shift in focus from Santa to the narrator coincides with a change in clips, enhancing the childs understanding of that shift .",learning sign language
"So the signer was lockstep with the text layout which also, appropria tely, highlighted the narrative rather than the rhyme scheme.",stories
"In the text , rhyme also overrides narrative shifts.",stories
"For example, here are two couplets: A wink of his eye and a twist of his head/ soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.",stories
"He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work, / and filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk.",stories
"Our signer, instead, prese nts the information in two clips this way: 4:27-4:32A wink of his eye and a twist of his head /soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.",learning sign language
"He spoke not a word 4:33-4:44 but went stra ight to his work,/ and filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk.",stories
"161 Revi sta Sinalizar, v.1, n.2, p. 152 -178, jul./dez.",stories
"2016 The clip organization corresponds to action organization (before and after Santa begins working) , rather than text rhyme organization; thus the clip organization reinforces the narrative for the child.",stories
"Finally, our signer omitted the couplet As dry leaves that before the wild h urricane fly,/when they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky .",learning sign language
This complex text metaphor neither clarifies nor advances the narrative .,identities of deaf
Plus the s yntax is convoluted to facilitat e rhyme .,learning sign language

Th e ability of spoken rhyme to do this de pends on auditory access to rhyme.,identities of deaf
Our signers employ rhyme as well sign rhyme.,learning sign language
"A sign can be analyzed as consisting of handshape, movement, and location (K ANEKO , 2011 ; simplifying from the original proposal in S TOKOE , 1960 ).",learning sign language
"In basic terms, i f only one differs, we ha ve strong rhyme; if two differ, we have weak rhyme (V ALLI , 1993).",learning sign language
"For example, i n the outset of this ebook , we find three sign rhymes .",learning sign language
"Here we give the couplet in English with the AS L in the first and second clips below the text: 0:09-0:19 Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house I LOOK -BACK NIGHT BEFORE CH RISTMAS HOUSE ALL -AROUND QUIET1 0:20-0:28 Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.",learning sign language
"LOOK -FOR EMPTY -EVERYWHERE MOUSE LOO K-FOR NOTHING The signs ALL-AROUND (0:16 ) and EMPTY -EVERYWHERE (0.23 -0.24) strongly rhyme, differing by handshape.",learning sign language
"The sign s HOUSE (0:15 ) and QUIET (0:17 -0:18) rhyme , differing only by movement 1 We adopt the usual convention of using small capitals to indicate signs.",learning sign language
"162 Revi sta Sinalizar, v.1, n.2, p. 152 -178, jul./dez.",learning sign language
2016 and the fact that QUIET changes palm orientation .,learning sign language
"The signs MOUSE (0:25 ) and LOOK -FOR (0:21 , repeated in 0:26 ) weakly rhyme, differing by location and movement, as well as by the fact that MOUSE is one -handed, while the signer uses both hands for LOOK -FOR.",learning sign language
Rhythm .,stories
"The English poem is dogg edly anapestic tetrameter (four feet per line, each foot having three beats in the pattern weak -weak -strong) .",learning sign language
"But all texts , prose or poetry, tend to be read aloud with a meter (GUA TELLA, 1999).",stories
"T he perception of rhythm may be critical to gaining literacy ( HUSS , et al.",learning sign language
", 2011).",identities of deaf
"Thus if sign stories are to give the deaf child wha tever advantage rhythm gives the hearing child in an SRA, they also must establish a rhythm.",stories
"And rhythm in sign literatur e helps capture the attention o f younger deaf children (B LONDEL , &MILLER , 2000, 2001).",learning sign language
"Varying the size of a signs movement path, alternating signs with different movement path lengths , and changing movement dynamics all establish rhythm (VALLI , 1993).",learning sign language
"Ways to show rhythmic closure include resting or holding a sign after performing several in quick succession (M ALER, 2013, section 3.9), as well as pulsing that is body beats while holding or repeating a sign (MALER, 2013, section 3.10).",learning sign language
All our signers established clear rhythms ; this signer is a good example .,learning sign language
"Fingerspelling, in particular, has a strong beat, as in the rendering of these lines: And he whistled and shouted and called them by name.",learning sign language

"The signer thrusts a pointing finger first to one side and fingerspells a name , then to the other side and fingerspells a name .",learning sign language
"The strong beat and body shifts right, left emphasize parallelism b etween intonational phrases and meanings.",learning sign language
Rhythmic phrases have end holds (pauses in which handshape and location are held steady at the end of the phrase) .,learning sign language
Looking again at the first two cl ips we mark the holds: I LOOK -BACK NIGHT BEFORE CH RISTMAS [hold 1]HOUSE ALL -AROUND QUIET [hold 2] LOOK -FOR EMPTY -EVERYWHERE [hold 3]MOUSE LOOK -FOR NOTHING [hold 4] Thus these clips have an internal st ructure: hemistichs (each line is com prised of two parts of equal duration) .,learning sign language
"The end of each hemistich is also indicated by a nonmanual marker (an articulation of something ot her than the hands, such as eyes, eyebrows, head, and so on ).",learning sign language
Hold 1 (0:14) and hold 2 (0:18) are accompanied by a head nod.,learning sign language
"At hold 3 (0:25) the eyes go from squint 163 Revi sta Sinalizar, v.1, n.2, p. 152 -178, jul./dez.",learning sign language
"2016 to fully open, then blink.",stories
At hold 4 (0:28) we have a blink.,learning sign language
"Holds and supporting nonmanuals mark rhythmic closures throughout the story , always coinciding with semantic groupings.",stories
"In contrast, when there is a semantic grouping that continues from one clip to the next, the signer makes these transition s obvious via articulatory means .",learning sign language
One transition method is to repeat the sign from the end of one clip at the beginning of the next.,learning sign language
"For example, the clip corresponding to the text had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap (1:23 -1:30) ends with the sign FALL -ASLEEP (1:30).",learning sign language
"The next clip (1:31 -1.38) corresponds to two couplets: When out on the r oof there arose such a clatter, / I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.",learning sign language
"Away to the window I flew like a flash, / tore open the shutter, and threw up the sash The signer repeats the sign FALL -ASLEEP (1:31 -1:32) at the start of this clip, linking the temporal unity of the two events of falling asleep and the clatter on the roof.",learning sign language
The other transition method is to quickly mov e from the end of one clip to the beginning of the next .,learning sign language
"This happens between the clip immediately above (1:31 -1:38) and the clip following, corresponding to this couplet (1:39 -1:47) : The moon on th e breast of the new -fallen snow/ gave the lustre of midday to objects below .",stories

"Our signer , instead, uses frequent repetition , a gratifying finding given that repetition helps with language development; the first time a language unit is used, the child can note it, but on later times, the child is primed to mimic (CORRIGAN, 1980) .",learning sign language
"Repetition can be of many types: semantic units, phonetic ones , whole signs, and ent ire sequences (S UTTON -SPENCE , & KANEKO , 2016 ).",learning sign language

This instance of three s introduces information not in the text or the illustrations (candy and cookies) in order t o do important vocabulary work .,learning sign language
Candy and cookies are familiar sweets.,stories
But sugar plums are unfamiliar .,stories
The signer deftly teaches the child what sugar plums are withou t being pedant ic.,learning sign language
"This inferential learning is implicit at the particular level ( two sweets follo wed by a third item , so it must also be a sweet) and at the general level ( two similar thing s followed by an unknown , so it must be similar to the others ).",learning sign language
"Groups of three are likewise repeated in the clip already cited above, 4:33-4:44, as we see Santa fill each of the stockings hanging from the chimney.",stories
"Phonetic repetit ions occur often in the signed story, as do full sign repetitions, including ALL-AROUND (0:16 and 0:57), HOUSE (0:15, 0:56, 2:38), FAMILY (0:32 and 0:58).",stories

Transparency of literary techniques Sophisticated literary techniques can become transparent in signing .,stories
"M uch of signing involves iconicity (P ERNISS , THOMPSON , & V IGLIOCCO , 2010), analogy (S UTTON -SPENCE , & NAPOLI , 2013), and metaphor (T AUB , 2001) , and the signing in this ebook is no exception .",learning sign language

"But w hile our signer uses eyegaze instructively , he does not use child -directed sign.",learning sign language
Eyegaze .,learning sign language
"Joint attention is defined as an observer following the eyegaze of an interactant to a target (C ORKUM , & MOORE , 1995).",learning sign language
"It is important for a successful SRA, particularly for deaf children (S WANWICK , & WATSON , 2007) or children with language -related special needs (K ADERAVEK , &JUSTICE , 2002).",identities of deaf
"Discussions of joint attention usually concern live 166 Revi sta Sinalizar, v.1, n.2, p. 152 -178, jul./dez.",identities of deaf
2016 interactions.,stories
"However, addressee s visually attend to a video narrators gestures if the narrator holds a gesture or gazes at her own gesture (G ULLBERG , & H OLMQVIST , 2006).",learning sign language
"Also, deaf preschoolers learn ASL from interacting with a screen character (H UANG , et al., 2008) , and show improved literacy -related engagement behaviors after watching educ ational sign videos (GOLOS, 2010), both of which results presume joint attention.",learning sign language
"A t least six types of eyegaze identified in sign literature (KANEKO , & MESCH , 2013) potentially foster/scaffold joint attention , and all are used by our signers : (1) narrators gaze at the audience.",learning sign language
Our signer opens with this and uses it often.,learning sign language
(2) characters gaze.,stories
An example is when Santa looks around the house (0:57).,stories
(3) spotl ight gaze on hand(s).,learning sign language
The signer alternates between narrators and spotlight gaze as he describes the stockings (0:29 -0:46).,learning sign language
"(4) reactive gaze on hands, showing how the signer feels toward what the hands tell .",learning sign language
This is in the two clip s about what the narrator see s when he opens the window (1:39 -1:47) and discovers a miniature sleight and ei ght reindeers (1:48 -1:57 the reactive gaze ends at 1:55).,stories
"(5) panoptic gaze , where the eyes add information to manual signs .",learning sign language
"When the narrator hears hoof beats on the roof, his eyes go upward and right , indicat ing the sounds source ( 3:01).",stories
"(6) prescient gaze , indicating future action by anticipatory looking.",stories
We find it in the clip corresponding to And away they all f lew like the down of a thistle (5:00 -5:04).,stories
"At the end, the signer raises his eyes, and at the beginning of the next clip, he rides off in his sleigh.",learning sign language
"Thus the signers eyes establish joint attention by looking directly at the camera, inviting the reader to return direct gaze , and by looking at a target, pulling the readers eyes toward it .",learning sign language
Child -directed signing .,learning sign language
"Some have argued that child -directed speech (with exagger ated prosody ) helps small children learn words ( mean age of 30 months; see GOLINKOFF , et al.",learning sign language

"Further, exaggerated pitch differences in child -directed speech help preschool ers interpret others emotions ( QUAM , & S WINGLEY , 2012).",learning sign language
"S o we might expect child -directed signing (again, studied mostly with respect to preschoolers) during SRAs to h elp children gain vocabulary and better understand characters emotions in stories .",learning sign language
"Child -directed signing by deaf parents uses larger, slower, more repetitious signing (that is, with lexical -internal repetition) , as well as signing on the childs body or displacement of signs to within the childs visual field (HOLZRICHTER , & M EIER , 2000 ) all of which help direct the childs attention to the language act.",learning sign language
In this ebook many signs are large and slow .,learning sign language
"167 Revi sta Sinalizar, v.1, n.2, p. 152 -178, jul./dez.",stories
"2016 However, the size and rate of signing correspond to narrative structure , not visual salience of individual signs.",learning sign language
"In general, our signer places ve rbs toward the end of a clip, a nd often they are larger and slower .",learning sign language
"But nothing about his signing suggests it is child -directed, not the type of repetitions nor the lexical items used (and see H OLZRICHTER ,& M EIER , 2000 ).Instead, our signer helps develop vocabulary by using signs in isolation or in brief utterances as well as stressing signs (by lengthened duration and increased size (DE TEMPLE , & SNOW , 2003, p. 18).",learning sign language
"But he keeps in mind pleasure for b oth child and adult; o n an adult reader, child -directed language soon wears thin.",stories
So the lack of child -directed language was an aesthetic judgment on our signers part .,learning sign language

"If both parent and child are to want to repeat SRAs, both must enjoy it.",learning sign language
Weve selected the source books for our ebooks with both parent and ch ild in mind.,stories
And our signers use signing that should be pleasing to both child and adult (they have a voided child -directed signing).,learning sign language
"We suggest, then, that parent and child can share these ebooks in whatever way they want.",stories
The parent might simply read the text while the child looks at the videos.,learning sign language
The parent might point to illustrations and try to guess what part of the signing is describing the visuals that the illustrations are providing (such as the children snug in bed i n the Santa story) and then ask the child to make further guesses (perhaps about the loops of decorations on the mantelpiece).,learning sign language
The parent might imitate the actions in the story acting them out like a mime and invite the child to do the same.,stories
The pare nt could copy the signer and encourage the child to do the same.,learning sign language
"168 Revi sta Sinalizar, v.1, n.2, p. 152 -178, jul./dez.",stories
"2016 As signing knowledge grows, the parent and child could have conversations in sign about the story, and then about whats going to happen in their home on the next holiday, and then about whatever else they want.",learning sign language
"That is, interaction may be minimal or it may be prolonged and complex.",learning sign language
"So long as both parent and child are enjoying themselves, repeated sharings of the ebooks will almost assuredly result in improved signing skills for both, and in increased language interaction over the books, which cannot help but develop better understanding of narrative and characterization.",learning sign language
"That is, we hope that these unscripted and joyful SRAs will be as fruitful for the emergent deaf reader as unscripted and joyful SRAs are for the emergent h earing reader.",learning sign language

It has only been recently that some have begun to compare portrayals of deafness for pathological vs. cultural perspectives.,identities of deaf
"Although there has been an increasing awareness of Deaf culture, evidence from empirical studies suggests that the pathological perspective prevails (Golos, 2010; Golos and Moses, 2011; Golos et al., 2012).",identities of deaf
"For example, we content analyzed the text and illustrations of 20 children's picture books published after 1990 and that included a main character who was deaf (Golos and Moses, 2011; Golos et al., 2012).",fiction books
"Results showed that the majority of messages related a pathological perspective of deafness (71% of messages in the text and 93% of the messages in the illustrations).Because of the prevalence of messages reflecting the pathological model of deafness, young readers may be more likely to experience books about deaf characters attending public schools and being mainstreamed with hearing children, as well as struggles they may face in such settings.",identities of deaf
"For example, more often they may learn about characters like Oliver who cannot hear and, as a result, is isolated until he receives his hearing aid (Riski and Klakow, 2001).Although cultural portrayals exist in children's literature, characters like Oliver dominate the literature.",fiction books
"We found that the most common pathologically-oriented messages included references to fixing the character's deafness and having a greater ability to function or an improved quality of life after receiving amplification (e.g., hearing aid or cochlear implant) (Golos and Moses, 2011; Golos et al., 2012).Another recurring message involved the deaf child in danger.",identities of deaf
"For example, in one picture book, there is concern that a deaf character might get hit by a car because the character could not hear (Roth, 2000).",identities of deaf
"In another story, an elementary-aged deaf child gets upset and runs into an elevator, does not know how to use it and gets stuck.",stories
"Other characters are concerned because the boy cannot hear their verbal instructions (Watkins, 1993).",stories
"Similar to the disability literature, these, and other similar messages found in the sample, perpetuate a stereotype of a deaf child as needing to be fixed or needing help to function in everyday situations (Carlisle, 1998; Golos and Moses, 2011; Golos et al., 2012).Although the sample was small, there were very few cultural messages found in the text and illustrations of the 20 picture books analyzed.",identities of deaf

"When his mother asks Moses how his first day of school was he responds, I have 10 classmates and all ten are my friends (Millman, 2000, p. 27).",stories

"For example, some books included messages related to positive relationships between the deaf child and his/her parent(s).",identities of deaf
"In Moonbird (Dunbar, 2007), the parents learn the importance of communication and valuing their deaf child for who he is, and in Dad and Me in the Morning (Larkin, 1994), a hearing father and his deaf child bond while watching the sunrise.",identities of deaf
"Moments such as these represent the critical connection between family members and their deaf child.One reason the pathological perspective dominates may be due to an increase in medical technology, such as cochlear implants.",identities of deaf
"As a result, deaf children are increasingly mainstreamed into general education settings or placed in self-contained classrooms.",identities of deaf
"However, in these settings, a deaf child often has limited interactions with other deaf children and/or Deaf adults, may not be taught or encouraged to use ASL and the classrooms often lack staff and/or resources to teach about Deaf culture.Recent evidence suggests that deaf children, regardless of use of amplification, benefit from exposure to visual language such as ASL (e.g., Mayberry, 2007, 2010) and exposure to culturally Deaf role models (e.g., Holcomb, 1997).",learning sign language

"However, to do so, they must contain accurate information about the Deaf community and Deaf culture.Ultimately, picture books could have considerable impact on children's perceptions of themselves and others.",identities of deaf
"If hearing children read (or are read) picture books that present a pathological view, they may learn that deafness is a disability, that a deaf person struggles in daily life, and that medical fixes are necessary in order for a deaf person to be happy, able to function, and be accepted.",identities of deaf
"For the Deaf child, such depictions may cultivate a sense of inadequacy and/or low sense of self regarding who they are and what they can do.",identities of deaf
"She/he may also feel the need to be fixed.If, on the other hand, picture books portray a cultural perspective of Deaf people, then deaf and hearing children could learn that Deaf culture exists and thrives and learn more about the language, history and values that are distinct from the hearing population.",identities of deaf
"Through exposure and discussion about picture book messages, the hearing population could even serve as advocates for preserving the Deaf child's language and culture.",identities of deaf
"Deaf readers may see that, like the main character in the Moses series, they can go to a school where Deaf teachers use sign language (e.g., ASL) and can learn to enjoy the arts, athletics, and academics utilizing their strengths in a visual language (e.g., ASL) and in a visual environment.",identities of deaf

"Parents and teachers can capitalize on these messages by discussing with children (hearing or deaf) how deaf people benefit from and access visual ways of being, such as using a light to get their dogs attention instead of calling him.",identities of deaf
"However, there remains a need for high quality literature that incorporates more of these types of messages.When pathological messages are present, educators should take the time to discuss them.",None
"For example, after reading the book about the deaf boy who gets stuck in the elevator, adults might ask children if they think that situation is realistic.",fiction books
"Or, they might present examples of how all children can use visual strategies (that deaf individuals use) to do things, such as cross the street.",identities of deaf
"Finally, children can learn that all deaf children, regardless of their use of medical technology or background can have friends, have skills and talents to share with others, and can lead meaningful lives.As an area for future research, we suggest that children's picture books be examined for their quality.",identities of deaf
"After examining some of the storylines and themes of children's picture books with deaf characters, one might question whether these stories would have been published if the characters were not deaf.",identities of deaf
"For instance, would a story be published about an elementary-aged hearing child who did not know how to use an elevator?",stories
"Although an empirical examination is needed to examine the quality of current literature, teachers should review storylines and messages in books before choosing to incorporate them in their classrooms.",fiction books
"The ultimate goal is to choose books that are worthy of children's time and attention that help develop their early literacy skills, and that provide important and accurate information about diverse populations.Children's picture books hold the promise to promote awareness and appreciation.",fiction books
"Yet in order to do this, diverse populations should be depicted positively and accurately.",None
"Picture books can portray Deaf Gain through images, fictional stories, biographies and other genres that portray the unique qualities and advantages of visual ways of being rather than the loss of hearing.",fiction books
"However, even when alternate messages are present these topics should still be discussed with children so they develop an awareness and appreciation in hearing readers as well as pride and connection to Deaf culture and the Deaf Community in d/Deaf readers.Just as our own favorite picture book from childhood stays with us through the years, so may the other characters and messages portrayed in picture books that display diverse people and diverse ways of being.",identities of deaf
"Picture books have the potential to influence our thoughts, perceptions and identity, and choosing and discussing picture books for young children provides daily opportunities to inspire and enlighten.",stories

"These frameworks were developed so that deaf readers would be successful, using more top-down strategies rather than focusing on bottom-up strategies.",identities of deaf
"Given that there are multiple pathways which can lead to successful reading for deaf bilinguals ( Allen, Letteri, Choi, & Dang, 2014 ; Andrews & Mason, 1986 ; Freel et al., 2011 ), we conclude this line of reasoning with a challenge to develop fault tolerant approaches that explore, permit, and encourage multiple pathways for all deaf readers to become successful.",identities of deaf
"These paths tend to challenge and avoid bottom-up drill as the most efficacious strategy for learning to read.Overall, classroom observations and research on deaf readers find that even young deaf children, with limited proficiencies in both American Sign Language (ASL) and English, when learning to read take advantage of signing and fingerspelling ( Andrews & Mason, 1986 ; Andrews, 2012 ).",learning sign language

"This approach has gained momentum and has been applied to early literacy learning as more deaf and hard of hearing children have access to the phonology of English with cochlear implants or digital hearing aids (see for example, Johnson & Goswami, 2010 ; Montag, AuBuchon, Pisoni, & Kronenberger, 2014 ).",hearing implantation
"However, Mayberry, del Giudice and Lieberman (2011) counter-argue that language, not phonological awareness, is the key variable to reading for deaf students.",identities of deaf

"Importantly, 35% of the variance was explained by overall language proficiency.",None
"Similarly, Geers and Hayes (2011) noted that deaf children with CIs had higher performance on more global literacy measures than on phonological processing tasks, suggesting to them that visual processing strategies provided alternative routes to reading.",hearing implantation
"Moreover, Clark, Gilbert and Anderson (2011) found the phonological awareness was not related to reading skills; some participants had near perfect phonology and weak reading skills while others were reading at the post-secondary levels with almost no phonological skills.",None
"Given this findings as well as other published work (e.g., Freel et al., 2011 ; Miller & Clark, 2011 ), we do not fully understand whether phonological skills are acquired after the development of reading skills, in contrast to the idea that phonological skills are precursors to becoming a skilled reader.What we do know is that compared to hearing children, it takes deaf children longer to learn to read, often three to four years and sometimes even longer ( Hoffmeister & Caldwell-Harris, 2014 ), with many youth plateauing at the fourth grade level even after nine or more years of education ( Traxler, 2000 ).",deaf
"Such low reading achievement levels are found worldwide with deaf children learning to read both alphabetic and logographic scripts ( Liu, Liu, & Andrews, 2014 ; Qi & Mitchell, 2011 ; Wang, Paul, & Lee, 2010 ).",learning sign language

"Factors That Impact Literacy and Deaf ChildrenThe key factor for deaf childs reading is early and full language access, whether the language is auditory or visual, ( Goldin-Meadow & Mayberry, 2001 ; Mayberry, Lock, & Kazmi, 2002 ; Mayberry et al., 2011 ; Pnicaud et al., 2013 ).",learning sign language
"Limiting the deaf child to only auditory pathways for language learning is risky, even with newer auditory technologies, such as digital hearing aids and cochlear implants, as they may not provide full access to auditory language.",learning sign language
"Therefore, these children need exposure to language models in both visual and auditory modalities from the time hearing loss is detected, to take full advantage of the sensitive period for language learning (see reviews in Humphries et al., 2014 ; Kuhl & Rivera-Gaxiola, 2008 ; Kushalnagar et al., 2010 ).ASL is a natural language, which has all the properties of spoken languages, with fundamentally different linguistic and grammatical structures ( Andrews, Leigh, & Weiner, 2004 ).",learning sign language
"Moreover, ASL occurs in a different modality (Traxler, 2012).",learning sign language
"Despite these differences, the brain does not differentiate between signed languages or spoken languages and children acquire either, or both, if the languages are provided in the environment ( Petitto, 2009 ; Petitto et al., 2012 ).",learning sign language
"Given that 95% of all deaf children are born to hearing parents, access to visual language is often not provided ( Andrews, Leigh, & Weiner, 2004 ).",identities of deaf

"Qualitative Similarity HypothesisA view articulated by Paul (2013) , as well as Trezek and Mayer (2015) , labeled the Qualitative Similarity Hypotheses (QSH), is that deaf children go through the same process as their hearing peers in learning to read, even if they are delayed in their reading milestones.",identities of deaf

"To overcome these limitations, Cued Speech was developed ( Cornett, 1967 ) and consists of eight hand shapes or cues (representing consonants) at four different locations around the mouth (representing vowel sounds).",learning sign language
These cues and mouth positions are used in combination with residual hearing and the visual information from speech reading to make the phonemes of English visible to the deaf child.,learning sign language
"A more recent system, called Visual Phonics (International Communication Learning Institute, 1996), is being used in deaf education and consists of 46 manual representations or hand gestures, with the 45 written symbols that correspond to the 45 phonemes of English, with a 46th hand gesture used to indicate the silent e. Each mouth movement is paired with a hand gesture to represent a single phoneme of English ( Paul & Wang, 2012 ).",learning sign language
"These visual markings are hypothesized to make English phonology available to deaf children, and allow them to develop reading skills in similar ways to their hearing peers, but often at a delayed rate.Easterbrooks and her colleagues ( Easterbrooks et al., 2015 ) also believe that auditory phonological awareness is important and follow the Simple View of Reading (SVR) ( Gough & Tunmer, 1986 ), which emphasizes that decoding skills and oral language development are needed for reading to take place.",learning sign language
"Here the use of fingerspelling was included in the model, but only in relationship to mapping onto the letters of the alphabet.In sum, the QSH researchers ( Easterbrooks et al., 2015 ; LaSasso & Crain, 2015 ; Paul, 2013 ; Trezek & Mayer, 2015 ) collectively suggest that both language-related and auditory code-related skills are needed for reading development.",learning sign language
"Each propose that proficiency in face-to-face communication of the target language (English), including its phonological aspects (whether presented auditorily or visually) are critical for the literacy development of deaf children.2.5.",identities of deaf
"Visual Language Learning & Mapping Sign/Fingerspelling to PrintPattern recognition of the smallest units of language is a skill that all language learners must learn, whether these be auditory sounds or units that are represented visually and tactilely through speechreading, articulatory feedback, Visual Phonics, Cued Speech, signs, fingerspelling or written letters (Andrews & Wang, 2015).",learning sign language
"In contrast to the above researchers who focus on auditory phonology, some researchers connect meaning to print by using visual phonology and sign orthography.",learning sign language
"This strategy goes directly from print to meaning ( Allen et al., 2014 ).",None
Here visual phonology (or alternative visually based ASL phonology or visual sign phonology) is the mechanism used to learn to read.,learning sign language
"This visual segmentation provides the prosodic and suprasegmental structure of signs, signed sentences, fingerspelling, and the orthographic patterns of letters.",learning sign language
"Allen (2015) studied 251 deaf children, ages 3 to 7 who had severe to profound hearing losses, examining the impact of early visual language on early literacy, cognition, and social adjustment.",identities of deaf
"He found that when fingerspelling skills were controlled for, ASL showed an independent effect on letter knowledge.",learning sign language
"Here, ASL skills were interpreted as being derived from a visually based phonological process that transfers to the learning of letters and an orthographically based system of sub-lexical units that can combine to form words and can occur independently of letter-sound knowledge as well as fingerspelling.",learning sign language
"Therefore, both ASL receptive skills and fingerspelling skills were strongly and independently related to childrens alphabetic knowledge (see Figure 1).",learning sign language
Allen and colleagues concluded that readingFigure 1.,None
"Path model showing impacts of age, ASL Receptive Skill, and Fingerspelling Skill on letter knowledge using a say or sign task.can be qualitatively similar to hearing children, if it is presented in forms that are modality independent, i.e., visually ( Allen et al., 2014: p. 355 ).",learning sign language
In addition Allen et al.,None
"(2015) found that among the three, four, and five years old within their database who had parents who used ASL, these children had the highest levels of letter knowledge.",learning sign language
This effect to a lesser extent was also found with children whose parents were only beginning to learn to sign.,learning sign language
"Children whose parents used only spoken language had the lowest levels on pre-literacy measures.Another model based on visual language and visual learning is called the Functional Equivalency Model ( McQuarrie & Parilla, 2014 ).",learning sign language
This model asserts that there are some aspects of reading for deaf people that are similar to that of hearing readers.,identities of deaf
"However, their work suggests that deaf readers crack the orthographic code in fundamentally different ways than do their hearing peers.",identities of deaf

Similar to the model proposed by Allen et al.,None

"(2014) and McQuarrie and Parilla (2014) , other work shows that visual pattern recognition of larger chunks of letters is also important.",None
"For example, deaf children who learn the print letter patterns of morphemes, which are highly regular, use these patterns as another visual learning strategy when learning to read ( Nunes & Bryant, 2006 ).",learning sign language
"They used materials based on morpheme teaching, linking their work to that with hearing children.",learning sign language
"Numes and Bryants participants, after given morpheme instruction, had significantly higher understanding of using suffixes in spelling, word reading, reading comprehension and writing skills.",learning sign language
"Similar findings by Nielsen, Luetke, and Stryker (2011) show the importance of morphemic awareness for supporting reading development for deaf children.2.6.",identities of deaf
Three-Stage Descriptive Model Hoffmeister and Caldwell-Harris (2014) propose another model grounded in visual language and visual learning.,learning sign language
"In their model, deaf children can become skilled readers, through reading and writing of English print.",learning sign language
They state that the phonology of English is not necessary.,Improve your English
"The authors emphasize that is it not deafness per se that causes reading difficulties, but a lack of full access to a visual language.",learning sign language
This lack of access to visual language causes the inherent difficulties deaf children have in acquiring language when they cannot practice it outside of the school activities of reading and writing.,learning sign language
"In this model, there are three stages of learning that represent successive, conceptual insights for deaf children learning their second language (English) through print.",learning sign language
"In the first stage of learning to read, deaf children learn how to map translations of familiar signs and sign phrases to print at the word and phrase level.",learning sign language
"In stage 2, the children progress to mapping signs to words and sentences, including idioms, metaphors, and multiple meanings.",learning sign language
"Then in stage 3, children use their bilingualism to learn additional English, through print in a bilingual, interactive learning mode ( Hoffmeister & Caldwell-Harris, 2014 ).",Improve your English
"In this way, a strong foundation in sign language is used as the bridge to becoming bilingual in both sign and a later developed spoken language.2.7.",learning sign language
"Whole to Part (Top down) ApproachRather than starting at the word/phrase level as proposed by Hoffmeister and Caldwell-Harris (2014) or focusing on letter knowledge as one indicator of emergent literacy ( Allen et al., 2014 ), a whole-to-part or top down model developed for hearing children was proposed by Mason and her colleagues ( Mason, Stewart, Peterman, & Dunning, 1992 ; McCormick & Mason, 1989, 1990 ) and was adapted for signing deaf children.",learning sign language
"This model can explain reading picture phrase books ( Andrews & Mason, 1986 ), reading expository science texts ( Andrews & Mason, 1991 ) as well as reading fables using ASL summaries ( Andrews, Winograd, & Deville, 1994 ).",learning sign language
"According to Mason and her colleagues, childrens earliest concepts about print and books are developed from their earliest experiences and interactions with storybook reading, environmental print and writing, as well as their own attempts to read, write, and make meanings from social interactions.",stories
"Early reading encompasses the awareness and experiences with reading, writing, speaking, listening and thinking, all of which occurred in the home prior to children starting the formal instruction of conventional literacy in the first grade.",stories
"This view of reading is not only historical, but is still relevant today as researchers studying deaf children continue to use these emergent literacy frameworks ( Herbold, 2008 ; see reviews in Trezek & Mayer, 2015 ; Williams, 2004 ).",identities of deaf
"These recent works show that signing deaf children by age five can identify environmental print, write their names, fingerspell their names, write most, if not all, of the alphabet, and recite back elements of storybooks after being read to ( Herbold, 2008 ; Williams, 2004 ).",learning sign language
"This framework includes four components, listed and explained below.1) Concepts and functions of literacy include knowledge of terms that are used to talk about reading.",None
"Here understanding the functions of print, knowing how the act of reading is carried out (i.e.",None
"knowing where to begin, and how to continue reading by turning pages), how to separate speech into words, syllables, and letters become the foundations of literacy.",learning sign language
"Then, being able to track a line of print and ones self-perceptions about reading are important components of becoming a reader.",stories
"Finally, context-sensitive strategies for word reading and knowledge of environment print in familiar contexts allow the child to become literate.",stories
These functions are top-down and provide the big picture about reading.2) Knowledge of letters and words functions as the bottom-up support for becoming literate.,None
"This knowledge includes letter knowledge, phonological awareness of beginning and ending sounds in words, grapheme- phoneme correspondence knowledge, and word recognition of common words and words containing generalizable patterns.3) Listening comprehension and word understanding again brings in whole-to-part strategies and includes complete or partial retelling of stories, defining, classifying, drawing analogies to words, and developing multiple strategies for reading texts.4) Writing and composing moves into the written forms of literacy, focusing on word writing, sentence dictation, and story composition.Here even though word identification and word decoding are important, the point being made is that early reading is more comprehensive than phonological awareness and vocabulary.",stories
"By extension to deaf children, early reading does not start at the one sign to one word mapping event, but can be initiated when a whole story or passage is presented in easy-to-read books with pictures, through signing conversations children have with adults, or with short passages of texts.Using a top-down reading model, as these studies suggest, is supported by research ( Supalla, Hauser, & Bavelier, 2014 ) in the short-term memory processes of deaf children and deaf adults who are fluent signers.",learning sign language
"On a recall task using ASL sentences, fluent signers (both children and adults) used top-down scaffolding in their working memory to retrieve the meaning of the ASL sentences.",learning sign language
"In contrast, deaf signers who were not fluent in sign used more linear strategies and visuospatial memory to imitate signed words.",learning sign language
"Additionally, they recalled lexical signs in linear order and omitted function words.",learning sign language
"Given these findings, Andrews and her colleagues suggest that to focus on early reading at the word-sign mapping or fingerspelling/decoding process is to miss the larger picture of what real readers dothe reading of complete texts, whether they are language experience stories, simple easy-to-read picture books, or more complex texts.2.8.",learning sign language
"The Five-Component ModelAnother model is based on visual language and visual learning; the theoretical underpinning is based on the literature about multiliteracies and the sociocultural view of literacy ( Kuntze, Golos, & Enns, 2014 ).",learning sign language
"This model is an alternative pathway, as reading comprehension is not only based on language acquisition and emergent literacy skills, but also learning a new language (ASL) as part of this process.",learning sign language
"This early reading model includes five components: ASL acquisition and visual engagement, emergent literacy, social mediation with English print, literacy and Deaf culture, and finally multimedia activities.",learning sign language
"It also includes the use of indigenous practices by deaf parents within their signing families; these interactions socialize deaf children into becoming readers ( Kuntze et al., 2014 ).",identities of deaf
"Their model suggests that the signing deaf children acquire reading through the visual modality, without access to spoken language, and that reading instruction should reflect these visual ways of learning.2.9.",learning sign language
ASL Sign WritingThe last model that uses visual language is one that develops reading instruction by having deaf children learn to read ASL graphemes and ASL glosses.,learning sign language
"Glossing is a written notation system devised to represent ASL ( Supalla & Cripps, 2011 ).",learning sign language
In the first stages children learn to match pictures of objects with pictures of manual signs.,learning sign language
"Then deaf children are taught a new writing system, which uses graphemes that represent the visual phonology of signs, including their hand shape, movement and location.",learning sign language
"In the third stage, children are taught to read English glosses for ASL signs, which is called ASL glossing.",learning sign language
"Supalla and colleagues use ASL gloss as an intermediary writing system, which links the childs ASL to English print.",learning sign language
"There is an ASL Resource book, with gloss text written in what the authors call the ASL-phablet.",learning sign language
"The ASL graphemes are written in a linear string to create sign equivalents of English words ( Supalla et al., 2001 ; Supalla & Cripps, 2011 ).2.10.",learning sign language
SummaryThese visual perspectives are noteworthy because they focus on the language of the Deaf community to bridge meaning to English print without the use of English auditory phonology.,learning sign language
"Moreover, reading instruction for English here involves using the linguistic structure of ASL to bridge meaning from one language to the other.",learning sign language
Not yet available is a strong science base to determine if these top-down models for deaf children are a promising avenue for learning to read.,learning sign language
So far these visual models suggest that there is more involved in learning to read than only bottom up strategies based on spoken language teaching curriculums.We do not dispute the fact that hearing loss exists along a continuum.,learning sign language
Ninety-five percent of deaf children have hearing parents.,identities of deaf
"Many deaf children have some residual hearing, which permits access to auditory process- ing strategies and other auditory cognitive processing strategies to comprehend print, especially if they have cochlear implants or digital hearing aids ( Marschark et al., 2015 ).",identities of deaf
"However, in view of the documented delay of the language and early literacy of young deaf children using auditory methods to teach reading ( Cupples et al., 2014 ), we think that alternative approaches using signs and fingerspelling are warranted, given the accumulating data showing the early sign language acquisition facilitates the development of early reading ( Allen, 2015 ; Clark et al., 2016 ; Freel et al., 2011 ; Mayberry et al., 2011 ; Pnicaud et al., 2013 ).As such, the five visual frameworks we present are united in that they suggest that all deaf children can be bilingual, where both ASL and fingerspelling can be used to become literate in English.",learning sign language
"Furthermore, they support the notion that the rhythmic and statistical regularities of ASL and fingerspelling have a facilitating role, in that it gives deaf children another tool, visual phonology, to use as a bridge to the learning of English ( Kuhl & Rivero-Gaxiola, 2008 ; Mayberry et al., 2011 ).2.11.",learning sign language
"Suggestions for an Alternative ParadigmThese five deafcentric frameworks focus on the visual language of ASL and visual learning, as well as the use of Deaf cultural role models in the teaching of reading.",identities of deaf

"Most likely, you learned the basic English greetings before you even started investing time in your language skills.",Improve your English
"But if you want to make the most of your first impression, there are a ton of more colourful ways to say hello.Do you want to know the most professional way to greet colleagues on a video call?",Improve your English

"As per professional speech in every language, the most appropriate response is neutral or positive Im doing well thank you / Fine, thank you to keep some distance, even if you are actually having a very bad day!If used as a formal greeting, sometimes How do you do is, strangely, used as a statement rather than a question.",Improve your English
This most often happens when shaking hands with someone for the first time.,Improve your English
It is easy to hear if this is the case: there will be no inflection at the end of the sentence.,Improve your English
"In this instance, the correct response is to repeat the question back to the asker in the same flat tone, How do you do?This is one of the respectful greeting examples you can use replying to someone you meet for the very first time.",Improve your English
"For example:When people meet, it is a common practice to shake hands.",Improve your English

"In formal communication, it is used to say goodbye.",Improve your English
"For example:To show your respect, you can also add the persons last name to your greeting words.",Improve your English
"Usually, native English speakers tend to be more informal even in business communication and use the persons first name after the salutation:It is also common to say Good morning, sir/madam when greeting someone in a formal situation whose name is unknown.",Improve your English
"This is often heard by staff talking to customers in shops, restaurants and hotels.Want to polish your conversational skills?",Improve your English
"Check out our article on the five main principles of small talk.In any language, many of the most formal conversations take place in written form: job applications, legal queries, complaints against a company.",Improve your English
