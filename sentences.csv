"But readers seeking titles grounded in a firsthand D/deaf, Hard of Hearing, or Deaf-Blind (DHHDB) perspective are unlikely to find many offerings.",stories
"Why arent we, the DHHDB community, writing our own stories?",stories
The answer is complicated.,stories
"American Sign Language (ASL) has a rich tradition of storytelling, but its a visual language with no written equivalent.",stories
"Additionally, as a result of a long history of discrimination against DHHDB individuals, stigma around hearing loss, and harmful and inadequate educational policies, including the prevalence of oralism and the practice of forbidding sign language in many schools for decades, some DHHDB people have low English proficiency.",stories

Now multiply that feeling by 100.That's the way Teresa and I felt after learning that Sam was deaf.,hard hearing
"We didn't know a thing about deafness or cochlear implants, but in the 9 months between Sam's diagnosis and surgery we committed ourselves to learn.",hard hearing
"In the process, we empowered ourselves to make decisions with confidence as we navigated the maze of medical, bureaucratic, and practical issues that parents in our position must confront.We also sought to answer more personal questions.",hard hearing
"For Teresa, there was a spiritual component.",hard hearing
"While dedicating herself to reading books and identifying resources in our area, she also held out for a miracle.",hard hearing
"Meanwhile, I wanted to understand why some people in the deaf community, including one of my coworkers, were so against cochlear implants.Teresa is a stay-at-home mom who used our children's daily naptime as an opportunity to employ skills she developed as a former bank auditor.",hard hearing
"If someone at the county level couldn't answer a question about resources available to the deaf, she sought help at the state level.",hard hearing
"If the state was slow, she contacted a politician.",hard hearing
"My wife's tenacity is the major reason we became so informed, and I will always be grateful to Teresa for charting our path.With a full-time job, I did less of the legwork.",hard hearing
"Still, I made sure my actions supported all of my wife's hard work and lessened the day-to-day stress related to it.",hard hearing
"We participated in online seminars and watched videos together, and neither of us attended any of the roughly two dozen formal and informal appointments we made without the other.",hard hearing
Teamwork made us stronger and more effective.One of the first lessons we learned was to be cautious about jumping on the Internet for quick answers before you know what you're dealing with.,hard hearing
"We found ourselves worrying about rare, heartbreaking maladies that we ultimately learned Sam did not have.",hard hearing
The hospital proved to be a better place for answers.,hard hearing
We met with a surgeon the same week that we learned Sam was deaf.,hard hearing
"From there, the hospital loaned us hearing aids and set appointments for an eye exam, a CAT scan, an MRI, genetic screening, and other testing associated with the implant process.Teresa laid all the groundwork necessary for a teacher of the deaf from the state's Early Intervention program to start coming out to work with Sam on a weekly basis.",hard hearing
She also began what turned out to be a lengthy process to get Sam his own hearing aids through the state.The hearing aid trial period is a necessary step in the implant process.,hard hearing
"Given the severity of Sam's hearing loss, the aids didn't provide much benefit.",hard hearing
"To Sam, they were little more than something handy to grab and chomp on.",hard hearing
But we persisted on the advice of a parent that we met.,hard hearing
"Sam needs to grow accustomed to this sort of equipment, and thankfully his desire to remove and eat his hearing aids eventually subsided.The hospital gave us contact information for other families whose kids had gotten cochlear implants.",hard hearing
"Also, soon after Teresa contacted a state agency, we began receiving calls from people in New Jersey's Parent to Parent Program, a statewide network of parents supporting families of children with developmental delays, disabilities, and special health needs.",hard hearing
"Having changed the batteries, gone to the therapy sessions, and watched their children blossom, families with real-life experience proved to be our greatest resource.",hard hearing
"Just as there is a deaf community, there is a community of parents whose children have implants.People shared their stories and even welcomed us into their homes, filling us with hope.",hard hearing
"Through them, my wife and I realized that prayer, the blessed oil she applied to Sam's ears, and the trips to Saint Katharine Drexel's shrine would not result in Sam miraculously waking up one day as a hearing child.",hard hearing
"The cochlear implant would be Sam's miracle, and the kindness of other parents helped us see it that way.About 5 months into the process, we decided to pursue a second opinion at another, larger children's hospital.",hard hearing
"I was reluctant to look elsewhere given the level of attention Sam received at the smaller hospital, where we ultimately stayed.",hard hearing
"While the second opinion didn't provide anything new from a medical perspective, I'm glad we went for it.The hospital staff invited us to a picnic for families of children with implants.",hard hearing
"We mingled with parents, surgeons, audiologists and, most important, kids.",hard hearing
We got to see and speak with children whose abilities astonished us.,hard hearing
We also received firsthand reviews of a nearby school that specializes in kids with implants.We spoke to parents about sign language.,hard hearing
Teresa and I hesitated to pursue signing for fear that it could impede the verbal strides that we hope Sam will make after he receives the implant.,hard hearing
"The parents calmed those concerns, inspiring us to use basic signs that, at 11 months, Sam is starting to try himself.",identities of deaf
"It's incredibly gratifying to see Sam give his best effort on the sign for milk or smile and kick his legs with excitement when Teresa makes a sign for cookie.We're not the kind of people who are comfortable striking up conversations with strangers, but we've learned that being more outgoing can benefit Sam.",identities of deaf
Teresa befriended a young woman with an implant working in Walgreen's and learned that she's thriving in a local high school.,identities of deaf
"After a call to a state senator's office went unreturned, I seized an opportunity to speak with him as he was waiting for his car at Jiffy-Lube, opening a relationship with someone who could someday serve as an important advocate for Sam's schooling.We tried to take any opportunity to learn that arose.",identities of deaf

"The next day I felt compelled to go.My coworker, not expecting me to show up, wasn't there.",identities of deaf
"I was alone with perhaps60 deaf people in a room filled with gestures punctuated with sounds of slapping and laughter, but no words.",identities of deaf
I felt very awkward as I struggled to communicate.,identities of deaf
"After about 40 minutes, I found someone's hearing spouse, who volunteered to help me.Person after person at the poker tournament told me the implant was a bad idea, but their reasoning did not move me.",identities of deaf
Their opposition seemed to be founded in dedication to the deaf community and in a strong belief that hearing loss is not an impediment.,identities of deaf
"I understood and sincerely appreciated those positions, but the conversations didn't produce the most meaningful lesson of that day.I was welcomed into this corner of the deaf world with open arms, yet it was clear that I wasn't part of it.",identities of deaf
I imagined the isolation that I felt as I milled around the room as an outsider would be something Sam could face on a daily basis in the hearing world if we didn't give him the chance to gain the ability to listen and speak.,identities of deaf

"Hearing losshappens when there is a problem with one or more parts of the ear, the nerves coming from the ears, or the hearing part of the brain.",identities of deaf
"People also may use the words deaf, deafness, or hard of hearing when they're talking about hearing loss.Someone who has hearing loss might be able to hear some sounds or nothing at all.",identities of deaf
Some kids are born with hearing loss.,identities of deaf
"A hearing problem can also show up later in life.To understand how and why hearing loss happens, it helps to know how the ear works.The ear is made up of three different parts: the outer ear, the middle ear, and the inner ear.",identities of deaf
These parts work together so you can hear.,identities of deaf
"The outer ear, or pinna (the part you can see), picks up sound waves that then travel through the ear canal.When the sound waves hit the eardrum in the middle ear, the eardrum starts to vibrate.",identities of deaf
"When the eardrum vibrates, it moves three tiny bones in your ear.",identities of deaf
"These bones are called the hammer (or malleus), anvil (or incus), and stirrup (or stapes).",identities of deaf
"They help sound move along on its journey into the inner ear.The vibrations then travel to the cochlea, part of the inner ear.",identities of deaf
The cochlea looks like a tiny snail shell.,identities of deaf
It is filled with liquid and lined with tiny hairs.,identities of deaf
The sound vibrations make the tiny hairs move.,identities of deaf
There are two types of hair cells: the outer and inner cells.,identities of deaf
"The outer hair cells take the sound information, make it louder and tune it.",identities of deaf
The inner hair cells change the sound waves into electrical signals.,identities of deaf
"The hearing nerve then sends the signals to the brain, letting you hear.There are a few different types of hearing loss:There are many reasons why a person may not be able to hear.",identities of deaf
"Hearing loss can run in some families, or a baby may be born with a problem with how the ear formed.",identities of deaf
Other causes of hearing loss include:Ear infections and fluid behind the eardrum can cause hearing loss.,identities of deaf
"When the infection goes away, hearing gets better.Doctors can do hearing tests at regular checkups or any time there is a concern that a kid does not hear well.",identities of deaf
The doctor will send a baby or child with hearing loss to an audiologist.,identities of deaf
An audiologist (say: ah-dee-AHL-uh-jist) is someone who does hearing tests and helps people with hearing loss.The audiologist checks hearing by doing different types of tests.,identities of deaf
They even have hearing tests for babies!,identities of deaf
Maybe you've already had a hearing test?,identities of deaf
"You probably wore headphones and had to raise your left or right hand to show that you could hear in each ear.The kind of treatment depends on the type of hearing loss, what caused it, and how bad it is.",identities of deaf
"Kids with permanent hearing loss are helped by audiologists; ear, nose, and throat (ENT) doctors; speech-language therapists; and teachers.Common treatments includeA cochlear (say: KO-klee-ur) implant is a tiny device that is put into the cochlea during an operation.",identities of deaf
It takes over the job of the cochlea and sends electrical signals directly to the hearing nerve.,identities of deaf
The sounds heard with cochlear implants are different from normal hearing.,identities of deaf
"With therapy and practice, all kids can learn what these sounds mean to better understand speech.A kid with hearing loss may go to a special school, special classes within a regular school, or be part of a regular classroom.",identities of deaf
Kids with hearing loss may need hearing and speech therapy.Some people with hearing loss use special ways to communicate:What about talking on the phone?,identities of deaf
There are phones that can make voices louder or a conversation can be typed out instead of spoken.,identities of deaf
The messages appear on a screen.You might wonder how someone who cant hear see a movie or watch TV.,identities of deaf
"Closed-captioned TV shows and movies provide text at the bottom of the screen, so people with hearing loss can read along to follow the action.So kids who dont hear well can go to school, talk on the phone, and watch a movie.",identities of deaf

"Las personas tambin pueden usar los trminos sordo, sordera o dificultad para or cuando hablan sobre la prdida de audicin.Aproximadamente tres de cada 1000 bebs nacen con prdida de audicin, lo que convierte a este trastorno en la anomala congnita ms frecuente.",identities of deaf
"Un problema auditivo tambin puede desarrollarse en una etapa posterior de la vida.Para comprender cmo y por qu ocurre la prdida de audicin, es til saber cmo funciona el odo.",identities of deaf
"El odo est formado por tres secciones: el odo externo, el odo medio y el odo interno.",identities of deaf
Estas partes funcionan juntas para que puedas escuchar y procesar los sonidos.,identities of deaf
"El odo externo, o pabelln auricular (la parte que puedes ver), capta las ondas sonoras que luego viajan a travs del canal auditivo externo.Cuando las ondas sonoras llegan al tmpano en el odo medio, el tmpano comienza a vibrar.",identities of deaf
"Cuando el tmpano vibra, mueve tres huesos diminutos que se encuentran en el odo.",fiction books
"Estos reciben el nombre de martillo, yunque y estribo, y ayudan a que el sonido avance en su recorrido hacia el odo interno.Luego, las vibraciones viajan hasta la cclea, una cavidad llena de lquido y recubierta por clulas que tienen miles de cilias diminutas en sus superficies.",fiction books
Hay dos tipos de clulas ciliadas: las externas y las internas.,fiction books
Las vibraciones sonoras provocan el movimiento de los cilias diminutas.,fiction books
"Las clulas ciliadas externas captan la informacin sonora, la amplifican (la hacen ms fuerte) y la afinan.",fiction books
"Las clulas ciliadas internas envan la informacin sonora al nervio auditivo, que luego la enva al cerebro, lo que te permite escuchar.Hay cinco tipos diferentes de prdida de audicin: conductiva, sensorial, mixta (conductiva y sensorial combinadas), neural y central.La prdida de audicin puede ocurrir porque una persona naci con partes del odo que no se formaron correctamente y no funcionan bien.",fiction books

"Este equipo puede ayudar a determinar cul es el mtodo ms adecuado para que el nio aprenda y se comunique.El tipo de tratamiento depende del tipo de prdida de audicin, de su gravedad y de las dems necesidades del nio.",fiction books
"Los tratamientos frecuentes incluyen medicamentos, cirugas, audfonos y otros dispositivos de ayuda para la audicin que, al resaltar las voces, ayudan a que los nios escuchen mejor cuando el entorno es ruidoso.",fiction books
"Con tratamiento, la mayora de los nios podr volver a escuchar normalmente.Los audfonos son una especie de amplificadores diminutos.",fiction books
"Ayudan a que una persona escuche mejor los sonidos e, incluso, pueden captarlos, de modo que lo que los nios oyen es ms claro.",fiction books
Los audfonos envan sonidos amplificados (mediante vibraciones sonoras) desde el martillo y el odo medio al odo interno o la cclea.,fiction books
"Se encuentra disponible una tecnologa de audfonos que pueden ajustar el volumen de los sonidos automticamente.Para algunos nios que no pueden or ni entender las palabras incluso con la ayuda de audfonos, existe un dispositivo llamado implante coclear.",fiction books

"Conductive hearing loss is usually caused by malformation, disease, or damage to the ear canal, ear drum, or middle ear.",fiction books
"Sensorineural hearing loss is usually caused by malformation, disease, or damage to the inner ear (cochlea) or hearing nerve.",fiction books
Mixed hearing loss is a combination of conductive and sensorineural hearing loss.,fiction books
"All types of hearing loss have a variety of causes and can be present at any age, even at birth.Optimizing your childs hearing can help with speech and language development, school performance, and communication.",fiction books
Bone conduction hearing implants are a special kind of hearing aid that has a surgically implantable component.,fiction books
"Depending on your childs age and type of hearing loss, your doctor may suggest this type of hearing aid.",fiction books
"These can help children with conductive hearing loss in one or both ears, mixed hearing loss in one or both ears, or single-sided deafness (profound sensorineural hearing loss in one ear with normal hearing on the other side).",fiction books
Bone conduction hearing implants can help children hear better when other kinds of hearing aids are not an option.Bone conduction hearing implants deliver sound by vibrating the bone in the skull.,fiction books
"For children with conductive or mixed hearing loss, bone conduction hearing implants bypass parts of the ear that are not working by sending sound directly to the cochlea.",fiction books
"For single sided deafness, the implant sends sound from the deaf ear to the hearing ear.These implants are inserted by an ear, nose, and throat surgeon.",fiction books
The ENT surgeon makes an incision in the scalp tissues behind the ear and places a titanium screw into the skull with specialized instruments.,what is hearing loss
The hearing aid component that is then connected to this screw depends on the type of bone conduction implant your doctor has recommended.,what is hearing loss
"The implant connects to an external sound processor either directly through a small opening in the skin or, more commonly, with a magnet.",what is hearing loss
Your child will receive the external hearing aid at the postoperative visit with his or her audiologist.Your child will be under general anesthesia (fully asleep) for the procedure.,what is hearing loss
"In this day and age, general anesthesia is very safe and your child will be carefully monitored by the anesthesia team during the procedure.",what is hearing loss
The surgery typically takes around 1 to 2 hours and your child can go home the same day the surgery is performed.Your child must have a physical examination by his or her pediatrician or family doctor within 30 days before surgery to make sure he or she is in good health.,what is hearing loss

Your child may have some swelling around the incision site.,what is hearing loss
"Your surgeon may recommend an ointment (most often Bacitracin, Vaseline, Aquaphor, or Bactroban) to apply to the incision for a few days.",what is hearing loss
Incisions should be kept dry for 2 to 3 days.,what is hearing loss
Stiches are self-dissolving and do not need to be removed.Your child may have mild discomfort after surgery for about a week after surgery.,what is hearing loss
"If your child complains of pain, you can safely give Tylenol (acetaminophen) or Motrin(ibuprofen), or other pain medicine prescribed by your doctor.",what is hearing loss
"If you are not sure what medicines are safe, please call your doctor.Fevers up to 102.0 F are considered normal after surgery.",what is hearing loss

"The audiologist explained that the parts of Sam's inner ear worked, but the equipment wasn't showing a response from the tiny hair cells inside his cochlea.",what is hearing loss
"Leftover fluid from birth was the likely culprit, he said.Any explanation seemed reasonable because the idea that our son could have a significant hearing loss seemed so unreasonable.",what is hearing loss

"It didn't.Her demeanor was a comfort as we settled in for the test, but as the test wore on we could read the growing disappointment in her face.",what is hearing loss
Teresa was sobbing and I was choking back tears as the audiologist turned to us to explain the outcome.The test measured Sam's brain waves in response to sound at various volumes and pitches.,what is hearing loss
He showed no response.,what is hearing loss
That means he never heard his mother's lullabies or his 2-year-old brother's laugh.,what is hearing loss
"In fact, based on the results, Sam wouldn't hear a freight train if he were close enough to feel the wind on his face as it rushed past.",what is hearing loss
"The audiologist said it differently, but those were the harsh facts as I saw them.Teresa and I asked about everything from the finer points of the word ""profound"" to the reliability of the testing equipment, even though we knew better.",what is hearing loss

I've lived for 17 years as a person with hearing aids in a mainstream world.,what is hearing loss
"However, it has been a long journey to get to where I am today.When I was 2, I went off to my first day of preschool on a little yellow school bus.",what is hearing loss
Most kids my age were happily watching Sesame Street at home.,what is hearing loss
"But because I had a hearing impairment, my parents felt that early intervention was the smartest option.",what is hearing loss
So I went to a school for the deaf for the first few years of my childhood.I did so well that the teachers decided to give me a new challenge: several classes a day in a regular public elementary school.,what is hearing loss
"I thrived there as well, and my parents and teachers felt that I was ready to mainstream (attend a regular school at my own grade level).My parents decided a private school might be best for me and they spent a lot of time interviewing different schools, looking for things that most parents wouldn't think twice about.",what is hearing loss
"For example, it was important that a school had carpeting rather than a tile floor so that sounds wouldn't echo and confuse me.I can still recall the day I met my new teacher.",what is hearing loss
She had big glasses and a shiny white smile and welcomed me with open arms.,what is hearing loss
She told me how excited she was for me to be in her class.,what is hearing loss
"At 4, I started kindergarten.I didn't really know I had a disability until I was at my new school and I saw all these kids without hearing aids and FM sets.",hearing implantation
"It was the first time I felt ashamed of my hearing impairment because I wasn't like everyone else.Whenever a classmate asked me about ""the thing in my ear,"" I would get upset and run away.",hearing implantation
My mother realized that I was having difficulty explaining this to the other kids and decided to do something about it.,hearing implantation
She arranged to have a speaker come to my class and talk to the kids about hearing impairment.,hearing implantation
I know that this helped kids understand because I eventually started making friends.,hearing implantation
I think that they were just scared to talk to me because they were clueless about what a hearing aid was.,hearing implantation
"Maybe they thought I was an alien or something!It turned out my FM set helped the other kids, too.",hearing implantation
"The device, which I wore around my waist attached to two ear-mold cords, was linked to a wireless microphone my teachers wore.",hearing implantation
One of my teachers would forget to turn her microphone off when she left the classroom.,hearing implantation
"Of course, we were rowdy when she left, but because I could still hear her, I was able to warn everyone when she was coming back.",hearing implantation
She'd find us all sitting in our chairs with our hands politely folded.,hearing implantation
That's probably why we were the only class that had an unusually high number of gold stars on the good behavior chart.,hearing implantation
"Not only that, I could hear everything the teacher said in the faculty lounge on the other side of school!",hearing implantation
"I don't think that I told her about that minor detail until the end of the school year.Once I started middle school, I started feeling more and more self-conscious about having a hearing impairment.",hearing implantation
"My FM set was no longer cool, and having speech-therapy sessions three times a week wasn't fun.",hearing implantation
"Because I had cleft palate when I was born, it was extra work to develop my speech skills.",hearing implantation
I really felt that my classmates thought I was mentally impaired.,hearing implantation
I didn't like feeling different from them so I threw temper tantrums in front of my mom and dad until they finally let me wear only hearing aids and stop the speech-therapy sessions.,hearing implantation
I was so relieved that the speech therapy I'd been having my whole life was finally over.I've always been prone to ear infections and I got a really bad one in fourth grade.,hearing implantation
"The infection was bad enough to require hospitalization, but my parents felt that going to the hospital would be detrimental to my schooling.",hearing implantation
"So they had all the hospital supplies shipped to my house and my mom acted as my nurse.Because I needed intravenous antibiotics to treat the infection, I had an IV needle put in my arm at the hospital.",hearing implantation
It was attached to a monitor that I wore around my waist.,hearing implantation
It was about the size of a fanny pack and I absolutely despised it.,hearing implantation
"On top of feeling self-conscious in general, I now had to walk around with all this bulky equipment on my body.",hearing implantation
"I was fortunate that my teachers and some of my classmates were sympathetic about my situation, otherwise I'd have had a really tough time emotionally.I've had about 15 operations on my ears since I was born, most of which have been tube replacements to help drain my ears.",hearing implantation
It is kind of funny how close I am to some of the doctors and nurses in the surgical department at the hospital.,hearing implantation
"It's similar to how people who play sports feel a bond with their coaches in my case, it's the doctors and nurses who are giving me tips and rallying me on.My most recent surgery was a tympanoplasty, which is a procedure to patch a hole in the tympanic membrane (eardrum).",hearing implantation
My doctor patched the eardrum by taking a skin graft of the inside portion of my ear.,hearing implantation
The moment I woke up from anesthesia I could hear my parents and the nurses without my hearing aid; it was a very joyous moment.,hearing implantation
"I can imagine that the happiness expressed on my face after the surgery was a truly rewarding sight for my doctor.Ironically, one of the side effects for me when I wake up from anesthesia is to cry.",hearing implantation
"After the tympanoplasty, my new hearing ability made it one of the strangest cries I ever had.",hearing implantation
"Later that day at the dinner table, my dad took a napkin and covered his lips (so that I wouldn't read them) and said something.",hearing implantation
"I repeated it with confidence.The surgery also allowed me to go into water (shower, bath, and a pool) for the first time ever without earplugs.",hearing implantation
"Earplugs were a problem for me, too, because I didn't like people staring at me whenever I was at the pool.Although I could hear better without my hearing aid after the tympanoplasty, the increase in volume was just enough for me to hear louder voices, but not whispers or quieter tones.",hearing implantation
So I still rely on two other forms of communication: a hearing aid and lipreading.My hearing aid allows me to distinguish sounds from one another more clearly.,hearing implantation
And I've become really good at reading people's lips!,hearing implantation
"It's a technique that I adopted at a very early age and will use for the rest of my life, regardless of my hearing capabilities.",hearing implantation
"My friends can't get over how I can pretty much watch people have conversations across the room and absorb what they're saying.When I need to hear sounds other than conversations or be sure I hear every word that's said, I rely on my hearing aid.",hearing implantation
"If I can't make a word out right away, I will go over the words that sound similar until something fits the context of the conversation.",hearing implantation
I do this first before I ask the person to repeat what they say.,hearing implantation
Otherwise it'd be really frustrating to have a conversation with me.,hearing implantation
"People often ask why I don't use two hearing aids and I honestly believe that my one hearing aid has enough power to compensate for the ear without the hearing aid.With new technology constantly evolving, I had an opportunity 3 years ago to replace my analog hearing aid with a digital one.",hearing implantation
It was tricky learning to adjust to the new hearing aid because of the way my old hearing aid magnified every sound.,hearing implantation
"The digital hearing aid is quieter and required a whole month for me to get used to, but I absolutely love it.With my digital hearing aid, I have better quality sounds processing through my brain.",hearing implantation
Once I was at a rock concert and my mom told me something in a loud voice and I replied back in my normal voice.,hearing implantation
I forgot that others can't hear the way I can!,hearing implantation
"Of course my mom asked me to speak up about three times until she could hear me decently.I'm going to attend James Madison University in the fall, which is an exciting thing for me.",hearing implantation
I'll have a chance to be in an environment where I don't know everyone.,hearing implantation
"This also means that I will have to explain my deafness to everyone that I meet, including my roommates.When I know I'll be in a new environment, I like to wear my hair down so that it covers my hearing aid.",hearing implantation
This way I know that people will treat me like any other person and not judge me before they talk to me.,hearing implantation
"Don't get me wrong, I have much more confidence than when I was in middle school.",hearing implantation
"I don't have any problems talking about my hearing impairment, and in fact, I would much rather have people ask me questions than talk about it behind my back.I've already started to prepare for college by getting an alarm clock that vibrates under my pillow.",hearing implantation
"This way I'll be respectful of my roommates, but I still worry about what I'll do in some situations, like when a roommate forgets her room key.",hearing implantation
Will I hear her knock?,hearing implantation
It's all a matter of adjusting independently to a new way of life.I often wonder about the things that the future will bring and if there will be a time in my lifetime where I will be able to hear normally.,hearing implantation

Are you asking because you like to put on your headphones and crank up the volume?,hearing implantation
"Maybe your mom or dad has told you, ""Turn that down before you go deaf!""",hearing implantation
"Well, they have a point.",hearing implantation
"Loud noise (from music or other loud things, such as lawn mowers or jet engines) can cause both temporary and permanent hearing loss.Hearing loss means someone can't hear as well as people with normal hearing.",hearing implantation
"For some people, that means not being able to hear at all.If the noise around you is so loud that you have to shout to be heard, there is a chance that youll have some trouble hearing.",hearing implantation
Loud noise can damage the parts of your inner ear that detect sound and send signals to the brain.,hearing implantation
Temporary hearing losscan happen when you are around loud noises.,hearing implantation
"If you have temporary hearing loss, you won't be able to hear as well as you normally do for a while.You also could have tinnitus (say: TIN-ih-tis), which is a medical term for ringing in the ears.",hearing implantation
"Your ears may feel ""full"" too.",hearing implantation
"Don't worry, it should get better.",hearing implantation
But hearing loss can become permanent if you listen to loud music or hear loud sounds over and over again.,hearing implantation
"To help prevent hearing loss, turn down the volume and wear ear protection the next time you're around loud noise.If someone is around loud noise often, over a long time, permanent hearing loss can happen.",hearing implantation
This means the person's hearing won't ever be as good as it once was.,hearing implantation
That's why construction workers and factory workers need to wear ear protection.,hearing implantation
"Lawn mowers and power tools, like chainsaws, are loud enough to cause tinnitus and hearing loss.Listening to loud music a lot can cause the same kind of damage, especially if you use headphones or ear buds.",hearing implantation
Some famous musicians have lost their hearing and have tinnitus that doesnt go way a real problem for someone who needs to hear to make music.,hearing implantation

2016 FUN BILINGUAL -BIMODAL EBOOKS FOR DEAF CHILDREN : DEVELOPING LANGUAGE AND PRELITERACY SKILLS EBOOKS BIMODAIS DIVERTIDOS PARA C RIANAS SURDAS: DESENVOLVENDO A LINGUAGEM E HABILIDADES DE PR-ALFABETIZAO DIVERTIDOS LIBROS ELECTRNICOS BIMODALES BILNGES PARA NIOS SORDOS: DESARROLLANDO LA LENGUA Y LA HABILIDAD DE PRE -ESCRITA Donna Jo Napoli Eugene R. Mirus Abstract Ebooks provide new ways to advance developing literacy among deaf children.,loud music
"While some aim to promote literacy through explicit pedagogical techniques, the new ebooks described here aim only to offer stories that are fun to share, encouraging learning through interaction that naturally fosters language and preliter acy skills.",loud music
Reading for pleasure is recognized as valuable for hearing children; it needs to be recognized as such for deaf children.,loud music
"We present the rationale for these ebooks and give examples of how they advance preliteracy skills, in the hopes that those raising and educating deaf children will use them, offered gratis on the Internet.",loud music
"Keywords: deaf children, literacy, ebooks, shared reading activities Introduction This paper describes ebooks of a new sort , which are offered gratis on the Internet .",loud music
"They are intended to promote language skills in deaf children, leading to overall better skills, at home and at school .",loud music
Most of the attention with regard to literacy in deaf children is focused on print -literacy skills.,loud music
"However, these ebooks also introd uce children to the mechanisms used in storytelling among the deaf, thus they promote sign -literacy skills, as well.",loud music

"2016 Background The new ebooks are founded on three propositions : fun is essential to learning, deaf childrens academic achievements depend largely on a firm foundation in a first language, and shared reading activities (SRAs) can be fun events that help develop a first language.",loud music
"First, play is a major wa y children learn ( KUSCHNER , 2008) , allowing connections critical to reading (G AMBRELL , 2011) and math (MURAYAM A, et al.",loud music
", 2013).",loud music
"It promotes health ( ALEXANDER, FROHLICH, & FUSCO , 2014), ethical development (E DMISTON , 2007), and lifelong happiness (M ARTIN , 2014).",loud music
"Deaf p reschool ers need to explore the wo rld through play, nourishing cognitive faculties their plastic brains are prime d to develop , like language (HUMPHRIES , et al.",loud music
", 2012) .",loud music
"Second, deaf chi ldren are at risk academically ( EASTERBROOKS , et al., 2015 ), and most point to lack of a solid language foundation (LEDERBERG, SCHICK, & SPENCER , 2013).",loud music
O ften deaf children are raised strictly orally; but the auditory information they receive may not prov ide language access .,loud music
"A bilingual approach has a better chance of protecting academic success since exposure to an accessible language is the key to developing native -like proficiency in any language, and a solid first language foundation is also critical for the successful acquisition of a second language ( MOUNTY, PUCCI, & HARMON, 2014, p. 334).",loud music
"Regardless of their speech skills, d eaf children who s ign do better academically (MAYBERRY, DEL GIUDICE, & LIEBERMAN, 2011) in reading (F REEL , et al.",loud music
", 2011) and writing (B ASHA , 2014) , whether their parents are deaf or hearing (H ASSANZADEH , 2012) , although socio -demographic factors play a secondary role (S COTT , 2015) .",loud music
"Third, we accept the conclusion of the 1985 National Academy of Education Commission on Reading: The single most important activity for building the knowledge required for eventual success in reading is reading aloud to children (A NDERSON , et al.",loud music
", 1985, p. 23).",loud music
"While much research before and after has focused on monolingual hearing children, the conclusion holds for multilingual ( KALIA, 2007) and deaf ( WILLIAMS, 2004) children , too .",loud music
"Thus, we interpret the 1985 conclusion to mean that shared reading activities (SR As) are fundamental to reading in mon o- and multilingual contexts whether speech is involved or not .",loud music
"Bilingual books in SRAs are used to enh ance print literacy around the world (SEMINGSON , POLE , & T OMMERDAHL , 2015).",loud music
"SRAs in crease vocabular y and teach narrative skills, 154 Revi sta Sinalizar, v.1, n.2, p. 152 -178, jul./dez.",loud music
"2016 particularly when adult -child interaction involves higher level facilitative language technique s (TRIVETTE , DUNST, & GORMAN , 2010).",loud music
"W hen adults ask open -ended questions about story comprehen sion then give the child time to consider and formulate an answer, the childs preparatory skills for print literacy grow (P ETERS , 2015) , including the ability to engage in inferencing (V AN KLEECK , 2008) .Further, the benefit in SRAs lies in fun throug h interaction , not through explicit pedagogi cal behavior , that is, in simply talking about the written text (hereafter referred to simply as text) (WHITEHURST , & ZEVENBERGEN , 2003).",loud music
"Many promote p edagogical SRAs for deaf chil dren, with guidelines for the parents, telling them to point to text words , fingers pell them, and sometimes even give a simple linguistic analysis of them (such as the NSF Science of Learning Center on Visual Language and Visual Learnin g (VL2) at Gallaudet University, which produces ebooks; see NAPOLI, & MIRUS, 2015).",loud music
"Often pedagogical SRAs focus on dialogic reading, where the parent prompts the child s response, evaluates it , expands on it, then guides the child to repeat it (FUNG, CHOW , MCBRIDE -CHANG , 2005).",loud music
Such SRAs are lesson s generally recommend ed for children over five.,loud music
What about younger children?,loud music
"SRAs are crucial for them (MOL, & BUS , 2011 ) and ebooks for deaf preschoolers must hold their attention .",loud music
"Once the deaf childs attention strays , she is no longer receiving the book.",loud music
"A hearing child cannot decide not to hear; even if her attention str ays, she is still exposed to the book .",loud music
Not so for the deaf child ; so fun is paramount.,loud music
"For the past two decades, education scholars have shown that early cognitive work marks the emergent print literacy period (MAYER , & T REZEK , 2015) .",loud music
"Included in that work must be firm first language acquisi tion (BECK , & O LAH , 2001) with extensive skills in vocabulary, syntax, and discourse (D ICKINSON , MCCABE , & E SSEX , 2006) , allowing the chi ld complex interactions with capable users of the language (M AYER , & W ELLS , 1996), as well as use of language to communicate with oneself, thus transforming thought into language (W ATSON, 2001) .",loud music
"The distinc tion between outside -in and inside -out information (WHITEHURST , & LONIGAN , 1998) in acquiring literacy is well accepted .",loud music
"Outside -in information includes language development , story structure, and conceptua l knowledge associated with comprehension , but not necessarily tied to text.",loud music
Inside -out information includes phonological and letter knowledge closely tied to text.,loud music
"While much research in deaf print literacy concerns inside -out skills and focu ses on the child 5 and older , outside -in skills are foundational: 155 Revi sta Sinalizar, v.1, n.2, p. 152 -178, jul./dez.",loud music
2016 inside -out skills allow one to translate print into words; outside -in skills allow one to understand what those words mean.,loud music
"Both are essential to reading, where outside -in skills are a critical step in learning to read for meaning (WHITEHURST , & L ONIGAN , 2001, p. 14).",loud music
"The ebooks here aim to encourage activities that p romote outside -in information in that they advance knowledge of a sign language, facilitate metalinguistic development, promote understanding of narratives, and introduce cultural kn owledg e necessary for understand ing texts.",loud music
"For example, a Christmas story informs about Santa Claus and his reindeer, putting the child in a better position to read texts about Christmas traditions.",loud music
"We conclude that SRAs develop skills necessary for print literacy through extensive playful language interaction ( DECKNER , ADAMSON , & BAKEMAN , 2006).",loud music
"Even for older children, the key to improved reading is the joy of getting lost in a narrative or being thrilled by discovery in nonfiction.",loud music
"Thats what makes the hard job of learning to read worth it (WILLINGHAM , 2015, p. 182).",loud music
"But hearing parents do not often engage in SRAs with their deaf children (E WOLDT , 1986) and, if they do, its typically not a pleasurable experience (SCHLEPER , 1995).",loud music
This needs to change.,loud music
SRAs for deaf c hildren Our areas of expertise led us to try to contribute toward the language development and education of deaf children by providing materials for fun SRAs.,loud music
"We are linguists; one of us writes childrens books; one of us is a former actor in the National Theater of the Deaf , being a deaf native signer of ASL .",loud music
"With our students, we produce bilingu al-bimodal ebooks for SRAs .",loud music
"The ebooks have illustrations and text , plus videos in a sign language .",loud music
"Ebooks with a sign narrator have been shown to increase the amount of time that families with deaf children spend in SRAs, a nontrivial result since longer exposure positively impact s language and print literacy development (M UELLER , & H URTIG , 2010 ).",loud music
"Most of our ebooks are English/ASL ; others are English/ IrishSL, Korean/KSL , Brazilian Portuguese/ Libr as, Nepali/ NSL , and English/ Fiji SL.",loud music
"As of August 2015, we have produced 16, but more are in production, including Japanese/Nihon Shuwa, Greek/Greek Sign Language, and Italian/LIS.",loud music
"The ebooks help with language interaction by providing good sign lan guage models for the family, for without a common language , the deaf child will be left out.",loud music
"That fact needs to be 156 Revi sta Sinalizar, v.1, n.2, p. 152 -178, jul./dez.",loud music
"2016 stressed: rich manual language exchanges with their mothers, in particular, are critical to the academic success of deaf children (CALDERON, 2000).",loud music
"The videos in these new ebooks promote language lea rning through contextual cues (CHALHOUB -DEVILLE , 2003), integration of visual and linguistic information (TANENHAUS , et al.",loud music
", 1995), and a reliance on world knowledge (CHAMBERS , et al., 2002).",loud music
Hearing family members can also use the text when learning to sign.,loud music
"The language support here is somewhat similar to that in multimedia stories for multilingual hearing children, su ch as the books created with Fabula software and used across Europe (EDWARDS , MONAGHAN , & K NIGHT , 2000) .",loud music
"Fabula books are intended to support, among others, the child whose home language is a mino rity (often endangered) which differs from the school language (such as Welsh -English, or Basque -Spanish) .",loud music
"The books are read on the computer, with texts in both home and school language s. Children can click on a speaker button to hear the text read in both languages.",loud music
Researchers have found several advantages.,loud music
"First, the minority -speaking child find s support in scaffolding from reading skills (especially comprehension) in the home language to the school language.",loud music
"Second, the parent who speaks the minority language but doesnt read the school language can now share books with the child, and can use those books to improve their own use of the school language.",loud music
"Third, the majority -speaking child, who is often monolingual, becomes more aware of languag e issues in general.",loud music
"Similar advantages have been found in America with computer -based books using audio and video (SKOUGE , RAO, & B OISVERT, 2007).",loud music
"And, on point, in a study of bilingual -bimodal ebooks with a signing narrator where hearing parents were trained on how to use the ebooks with their deaf children, even parents who were noncompliant and did not underg o the parent training learned many signs purely from watching the sign narrato r (MUELLER , & H URTIG , 2010 ).",loud music
"Finally, the ability to review the vi deos promotes an analytical approach to both language and story (KRENTZ , 2006).",loud music
"The interaction of adult and child ren SRAs should help develop language and understanding of characterization and narrative, and establis h a love of liter ature .",loud music
"The nitty gritty: Selecting sources and making the ebooks We have no funding, so all books we use as a basis for producing ebook s must be in the public domain or the copyright holders must grant us their kind permission.",loud music
"Deaf children (and 157 Revi sta Sinalizar, v.1, n.2, p. 152 -178, jul./dez.",loud music
"2016 their parents) deserve hi gh quality reading materials, which we hope to guarantee by using standardly published books or books offered on the Internet that our students unanimously agree upon and that we test on hearing children before deciding to go forth with them.",loud music
"Within those limitati ons, we choose stories based on clear criteria.",loud music
"All must be visually rich and relatable to deaf childrens life experience s, to provide a welcome into reading (DENNIS , LYNCH , & S TOCKALL , 2012).",loud music
"For example, a book about taking a walk at night with a father and hearing an owl hoot can create a magical feeling in a hearing child but leave a deaf child baffled.",loud music
"Our books deal with ordinary events like birthday pa rties (in KEVINS BIRTHDAY), as well as extraordinary but visually exciting and easily comprehensible events like a runaway baby carriage ( in THE SLANT BOOK).",loud music
"In some a non -human character presents the story from a minority viewpoint, allowing de af children to identify.",loud music
O ne is about a dog w ho moves to a house full of cats (in ROCKY THE C AT WHO BARKS); another is about an egg that goes hard -boiled and bounces away rather than allowing himself to get cracked ( in HUMPTY DUMPTY).,loud music
"In one a character faces huge challenges , but with self -confidence and hard work, they are met a reassuring narrative (in THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD).",loud music
Some introduce classics that are part of the American heritage (such as TWAS THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS and JEMIMA PUDDLE DUCK).,loud music
"Four are no nfiction (produced with the kind permission of National Geographic), one relatable to the childs life ( in HALLOWEEN), two presenting information preschoolers are general ly held responsible for, metamorphosis and knowledge of African animals ( in CATERPILLA R TO BUTTERFLY and in SAFARI), and one presenting just plain old fun information for any child ( in RACE DAY).",loud music
"Most t hus far target the 3 and 4 year old , but a few are for toddlers .",loud music
"Once weve chosen a book, our students take over and we serve as sounding boards and guides .",loud music
"Half our students are at Gallaude t University and the other half, at Swarthmore College.",loud music
"All consult on format ting, such as whether to place the signer in a frame or surrounded by the background illustration.",loud music
All have studied deaf li terature and consult on how to tell the story .,hearing test
Gallaudet students act; our actors are deaf and signing is their primary and preferred mode of communication.,hearing test
Swarthmore students edit the film and do the production work .,hearing test
"All give feedback on acting, editin g, and production .",hearing test
"All ebooks for deaf children (not just ours) use storytelling techniques of sign literature : the visual vernacular (R IGGS , 2003 ), thus developing sign -literacy skills in the readers.",hearing test
"These 158 Revi sta Sinalizar, v.1, n.2, p. 152 -178, jul./dez.",hearing test
"2016 techniques lack counterpart s in writing, although texts can approximate : ALL CAPITALS for loudness, italics for emphasis, arrangement of letters to indicat e s l o w action .",hearing test
"However, visual -vernacular techniques have spoken counterparts in the form of voice alterations (GREENE BRABHAM , & L YNCH -BROWN , 2002) .",hearing test
"Certain visual -vernacular techniques give the deaf child advantages analogous to advantages reading aloud gives the hearing child (NAPOLI , & M IRUS , 2015 ).",hearing test
One such technique is varying motion speed (support for narrative changes).,hearing test
"Another is varying shot di stance , for example, showing a ho rse up close by letting the fists become the hooves, or at middle -range by le tting the nondominant hand become the horse while the dominant hand is a rider on the horse, or at a distance by having the two index fingers brush past each other like horses in a race seen from the stands (help in interpret ing how illustrations relate to plot).",hearing test
"A third is role shift , whereby the signer embodies one charac ter, then shifts (torso, head , or gaze) to embody another character (help in understanding ch aracterization and develop ing Theory of Mind see S CHICK , et al.",hearing test
", 2007 ).",hearing test
"But there is a critical way our ebooks differ from others: we encourage our signers to read the story, let it roll a round in their minds , then tell it without attemp ting to translate, in a way natural for them.",hearing test
"They practice to each other and to deaf people outside class , including children.",hearing test
"Final versions tend to integrate information fro m text and illustrations, and even new information that the class agrees fits (we discuss an example of th is below).",hearing test
"This kind of freedom respects the signers creativity and has led to excellent language modeling and, we believe, more fun.",hearing test
"With regard to language modeling, generally sign performers set the scene by using signs to present an essentially static image before creating movin g characters (S UTTON -SPENCE , & KANEKO , 2016 , p. 168).",hearing test
"Strict adherence to a text, in contrast , can result in grammatical but atypical signing.",hearing test
"And we note that signing d eaf parents do not feel constrained by text in SRAs with t heir deaf children (S WANWICK , & WATSON , 2005) , just as hearing parents dont when reading to their hearing children .",hearing test
"The signers in our ebooks likewise are not constrained; they use accessible , uncontrived language .",hearing test
"The acting creates visual images, then uses pauses to allow images to take hold, empowering the reader to imagine more (just as sign literature should do; R YAN , 1993) .",hearing test

"With regard to fun, the relative autonomy of the signers allow s them to enjoy develop ing their own metho ds, making each ebook unique, a welcome result since the complex differences in learning behaviors indicate that children should be offered reading materials which employ varying different strategies in helping decode and understand (M OORE , & WADE , 1998).",hearing test
Analysis of the new ebooks We here describe how the new ebooks can help by offering discussion of one : TWAS THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42nXcSIebPE .,hearing test
This is representative of our ebooks for the older preschooler .,hearing test
"Since it is a classic tale, we do not give the entire text, but simply zoom in on specific points.",hearing test
"The signer , Caleb Joshua Smith, has given us his permission to discuss every aspect of his work .",hearing test
Many of the decisions concerning how he would sign were made collaboratively with class members .,hearing test
Overall organization of original text and of sign r endering This text consists of 28 rhyming couplets.,hearing test
The spoken rhyme is tyrannical with respect to organization of the text.,hearing test
"First, it ignores change of focus, as seen in this example: He had a broad face and a little round belly, / that shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly.",hearing test
"He was chubby an d plump, a right jolly old elf,/ and I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself.",hearing test
"The first three lines concern the appea rance of Santa; the fourth, the narrators reaction .",hearing test
But rhyme forces couplets.,hearing test
"The book designer, however, laid out the text across three pages of the original storybook: He had a broad face and a little round belly, That shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly.",hearing test
"160 Revi sta Sinalizar, v.1, n.2, p. 152 -178, jul./dez.",hearing test
"2016 He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf, And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself.",hearing test
Here the layout does not respect the couplet structure; the second page straddles two couplets.,hearing test
"Our signer, in comparison , produced 37 video clips overall , whe re most clips corresponded to a page of text, but several times two clips correspond ed to a page .",hearing test
"He grouped these four lines (that is, the two couplets) above as follows , where numbers indicate the minute and second clips begin and e nd in the YouTube video that you can watch : 4:08-4:12 He had a broad face and a little round belly , 4:13-4:18 that shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly.",hearing test
"He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf, 4:19-4:26 and I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself.",hearing test
"Thus there are three clips, rather than two couplets; the shift in focus from Santa to the narrator coincides with a change in clips, enhancing the childs understanding of that shift .",hearing test
"So the signer was lockstep with the text layout which also, appropria tely, highlighted the narrative rather than the rhyme scheme.",hearing test
"In the text , rhyme also overrides narrative shifts.",hearing test
"For example, here are two couplets: A wink of his eye and a twist of his head/ soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.",hearing test
"He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work, / and filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk.",hearing test
"Our signer, instead, prese nts the information in two clips this way: 4:27-4:32A wink of his eye and a twist of his head /soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.",hearing test
"He spoke not a word 4:33-4:44 but went stra ight to his work,/ and filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk.",hearing test
"161 Revi sta Sinalizar, v.1, n.2, p. 152 -178, jul./dez.",hearing test
"2016 The clip organization corresponds to action organization (before and after Santa begins working) , rather than text rhyme organization; thus the clip organization reinforces the narrative for the child.",hearing test
"Finally, our signer omitted the couplet As dry leaves that before the wild h urricane fly,/when they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky .",hearing test
This complex text metaphor neither clarifies nor advances the narrative .,hearing test
Plus the s yntax is convoluted to facilitat e rhyme .,hearing test
No one who has yet shared this ebook has complained to us about the missing couplet .,hearing test
It seems quite skip-able.,hearing test
"In sum, our signers clip organization gives consistent support to narrative understanding .",hearing test
"The three Rs as aids to l iteracy Rhyme, rhythm, and repetition can all le ad to predictability, which helps the c hild anticipate plot and thus aid s in comprehension (BIALOSTOK , 1992).",hearing test
Rhyme .,hearing test
"Spoken rhyme can help children memorize the story and associate mem orized words to print (GELLER , 1983).",hearing test
Th e ability of spoken rhyme to do this de pends on auditory access to rhyme.,hearing test
Our signers employ rhyme as well sign rhyme.,hearing test
"A sign can be analyzed as consisting of handshape, movement, and location (K ANEKO , 2011 ; simplifying from the original proposal in S TOKOE , 1960 ).",hearing test
"In basic terms, i f only one differs, we ha ve strong rhyme; if two differ, we have weak rhyme (V ALLI , 1993).",hearing test
"For example, i n the outset of this ebook , we find three sign rhymes .",hearing test
"Here we give the couplet in English with the AS L in the first and second clips below the text: 0:09-0:19 Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house I LOOK -BACK NIGHT BEFORE CH RISTMAS HOUSE ALL -AROUND QUIET1 0:20-0:28 Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.",hearing test
"LOOK -FOR EMPTY -EVERYWHERE MOUSE LOO K-FOR NOTHING The signs ALL-AROUND (0:16 ) and EMPTY -EVERYWHERE (0.23 -0.24) strongly rhyme, differing by handshape.",hearing test
"The sign s HOUSE (0:15 ) and QUIET (0:17 -0:18) rhyme , differing only by movement 1 We adopt the usual convention of using small capitals to indicate signs.",hearing test
"162 Revi sta Sinalizar, v.1, n.2, p. 152 -178, jul./dez.",hearing test
2016 and the fact that QUIET changes palm orientation .,hearing test
"The signs MOUSE (0:25 ) and LOOK -FOR (0:21 , repeated in 0:26 ) weakly rhyme, differing by location and movement, as well as by the fact that MOUSE is one -handed, while the signer uses both hands for LOOK -FOR.",hearing test
Rhythm .,hearing test
"The English poem is dogg edly anapestic tetrameter (four feet per line, each foot having three beats in the pattern weak -weak -strong) .",hearing test
"But all texts , prose or poetry, tend to be read aloud with a meter (GUA TELLA, 1999).",hearing test
"T he perception of rhythm may be critical to gaining literacy ( HUSS , et al.",hearing test
", 2011).",hearing test
"Thus if sign stories are to give the deaf child wha tever advantage rhythm gives the hearing child in an SRA, they also must establish a rhythm.",hearing test
"And rhythm in sign literatur e helps capture the attention o f younger deaf children (B LONDEL , &MILLER , 2000, 2001).",hearing test
"Varying the size of a signs movement path, alternating signs with different movement path lengths , and changing movement dynamics all establish rhythm (VALLI , 1993).",hearing test
"Ways to show rhythmic closure include resting or holding a sign after performing several in quick succession (M ALER, 2013, section 3.9), as well as pulsing that is body beats while holding or repeating a sign (MALER, 2013, section 3.10).",hearing test
All our signers established clear rhythms ; this signer is a good example .,hearing test
"Fingerspelling, in particular, has a strong beat, as in the rendering of these lines: And he whistled and shouted and called them by name.",hearing test
"/Now, Dasher!",hearing test
"Now, D ancer!",hearing test
"Now, Prancer and Vixen!",hearing test
/ On Comet!,hearing test
"On, Cupid!",hearing test
"On, Donner and Blitzen!",hearing test
"The signer thrusts a pointing finger first to one side and fingerspells a name , then to the other side and fingerspells a name .",ear poisoning
"The strong beat and body shifts right, left emphasize parallelism b etween intonational phrases and meanings.",ear poisoning
Rhythmic phrases have end holds (pauses in which handshape and location are held steady at the end of the phrase) .,ear poisoning
Looking again at the first two cl ips we mark the holds: I LOOK -BACK NIGHT BEFORE CH RISTMAS [hold 1]HOUSE ALL -AROUND QUIET [hold 2] LOOK -FOR EMPTY -EVERYWHERE [hold 3]MOUSE LOOK -FOR NOTHING [hold 4] Thus these clips have an internal st ructure: hemistichs (each line is com prised of two parts of equal duration) .,ear poisoning
"The end of each hemistich is also indicated by a nonmanual marker (an articulation of something ot her than the hands, such as eyes, eyebrows, head, and so on ).",ear poisoning
Hold 1 (0:14) and hold 2 (0:18) are accompanied by a head nod.,ear poisoning
"At hold 3 (0:25) the eyes go from squint 163 Revi sta Sinalizar, v.1, n.2, p. 152 -178, jul./dez.",ear poisoning
"2016 to fully open, then blink.",ear poisoning
At hold 4 (0:28) we have a blink.,ear poisoning
"Holds and supporting nonmanuals mark rhythmic closures throughout the story , always coinciding with semantic groupings.",ear poisoning
"In contrast, when there is a semantic grouping that continues from one clip to the next, the signer makes these transition s obvious via articulatory means .",ear poisoning
One transition method is to repeat the sign from the end of one clip at the beginning of the next.,ear poisoning
"For example, the clip corresponding to the text had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap (1:23 -1:30) ends with the sign FALL -ASLEEP (1:30).",ear poisoning
"The next clip (1:31 -1.38) corresponds to two couplets: When out on the r oof there arose such a clatter, / I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.",ear poisoning
"Away to the window I flew like a flash, / tore open the shutter, and threw up the sash The signer repeats the sign FALL -ASLEEP (1:31 -1:32) at the start of this clip, linking the temporal unity of the two events of falling asleep and the clatter on the roof.",ear poisoning
The other transition method is to quickly mov e from the end of one clip to the beginning of the next .,ear poisoning
"This happens between the clip immediately above (1:31 -1:38) and the clip following, corresponding to this couplet (1:39 -1:47) : The moon on th e breast of the new -fallen snow/ gave the lustre of midday to objects below .",ear poisoning
Repetition .,ear poisoning
The English poem uses little repetition; the only example is seen in this one passage : Now Dasher !,ear poisoning
Now Dancer!,ear poisoning
Now Prancer and Vixen!,ear poisoning
"/On, Comet!",ear poisoning
"On, Cupid!",ear poisoning
"On, Donner and Blitzen!",ear poisoning
/To the top of the porch!,ear poisoning
To the top of the wall!,ear poisoning
/ Now dash away!,ear poisoning
Dash away!,ear poisoning
Dash away all!,ear poisoning
"Our signer , instead, uses frequent repetition , a gratifying finding given that repetition helps with language development; the first time a language unit is used, the child can note it, but on later times, the child is primed to mimic (CORRIGAN, 1980) .",ear poisoning
"Repetition can be of many types: semantic units, phonetic ones , whole signs, and ent ire sequences (S UTTON -SPENCE , & KANEKO , 2016 ).",ear poisoning
"With respect to semant ic units, the single line The stockings were hung by the chimney with care is rendered by a long clip (0:29 -0:46) .",ear poisoning
"The signer tells us to take a close look, and well see that the house is decorated.",ear poisoning
"He introduces the mantelpiece (0:36), indicating loops 164 Revi sta Sinalizar, v.1, n.2, p. 152 -178, jul./dez.",ear poisoning
"2016 there three, in fact (0:37 -0:39).",ear poisoning
"He tells of red (0:40) stock ings three, again (0:41 -0:42) with white (0:43) cuffs on top (0:44-0:46).",ear poisoning
"The three loops set us up for the three stockings, which sets us up for the three cuffs.",ear poisoning
"I n each case the first, second, and third insta nce o f a sign is given in consecutive location points along a spatial line, moving from signers left to right.",ear poisoning
T he reader is primed by the first instance t o mimic the second and third .,ear poisoning
We find this same re petition of threes in the clip corresponding to the text line The children were nestled all snug in their beds (0:55 -1:04).,ear poisoning
"Here we are told about three beds with a child in each, again along that spatial line from left to right.",ear poisoning
And threes come up in the video corresponding to the t ext line: While visions of sugar -plums danced in their heads (1:05 -1:15).,ear poisoning
"The signer introduces CANDY (1:07), follo wed by pointing at three spots high in the air (1:08), COOKIES (1:09), foll owed by pointing to those spots again (1:10), and finally SUGAR P -L-U-M-S2(1:11 -1:12), foll owed by pointing to the spots (1:13).",ear poisoning
"So there ar e three similar objects, with three pointings in space after each .",ear poisoning
This instance of three s introduces information not in the text or the illustrations (candy and cookies) in order t o do important vocabulary work .,ear poisoning
Candy and cookies are familiar sweets.,ear poisoning
But sugar plums are unfamiliar .,ear poisoning
The signer deftly teaches the child what sugar plums are withou t being pedant ic.,ear poisoning
"This inferential learning is implicit at the particular level ( two sweets follo wed by a third item , so it must also be a sweet) and at the general level ( two similar thing s followed by an unknown , so it must be similar to the others ).",ear poisoning
"Groups of three are likewise repeated in the clip already cited above, 4:33-4:44, as we see Santa fill each of the stockings hanging from the chimney.",ear poisoning
"Phonetic repetit ions occur often in the signed story, as do full sign repetitions, including ALL-AROUND (0:16 and 0:57), HOUSE (0:15, 0:56, 2:38), FAMILY (0:32 and 0:58).",ear poisoning
S ometimes the s igner marks clips as semant ically parallel by ending t hem with the same sign.,ear poisoning
"O f the four clips corresponding to the four lines below, all but the third ends with the sign FALL -ASLEEP : 0:55-1:04 The children were nestled all snug in their beds 1:05-1:15 while visions of sugar plums danced in their heads 1:16-1:22 And Mama in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap 1:23-1:30 had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap 2 We adopt the usual convention of using hyphens between letters to indicate fingerspelling.",ear poisoning
"165 Revi sta Sinalizar, v.1, n.2, p. 152 -178, jul./dez.",ear poisoning
2016 But the most striking repetition is of sequences.,ear poisoning
"The signer often rem inds us he is Santa, and he drives reindeers (1:55 -1:57, 2:02 -2:04, 2:12 -2:13, 2:34 -2:35, 5:06-5:07).",ear poisoning
The story ends perfectly with Santa driving that sleigh a final time ( one quick move and a hold in 5:20).,ear poisoning
Transparency of literary techniques Sophisticated literary techniques can become transparent in signing .,ear poisoning
"M uch of signing involves iconicity (P ERNISS , THOMPSON , & V IGLIOCCO , 2010), analogy (S UTTON -SPENCE , & NAPOLI , 2013), and metaphor (T AUB , 2001) , and the signing in this ebook is no exception .",ear poisoning
"A text simile is rendered by a sign simile with explicit LIKE in the second clip here: 3:55-4:00 The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth, and the smoke it encircled .. 4:01-4:07 .",ear poisoning
his head like a wreath .,ear poisoning
.MY ALL -AROUND -FACE EDGES -OF-HEAD LIKE CHRISTMAS W-R-E-A-T-H We see another text simile handled by simple sign juxtaposition (perhaps a metaphor) in: and the beard on his chin was as white as the snow (3:51 -3:54).,ear poisoning
"The signer introduces a graphic metaphor in the clip corresponding to this line: The children were nestled all snug in their beds, (0:55 -1:04).",ear poisoning
"W e see the children in bed , then the signer tightens his fingers aroun d the last child (1:02), as a metaphor for snugness.",ear poisoning
Our signer is clearly helping the child become comfortable with similes and metaphors.,ear poisoning
Attention as a key to l iteracy .,ear poisoning
"In order for these techniques to work, the child must pay attention .",ear poisoning
Eyegaze is important here.,ear poisoning
"Further, one might expect child -directed signing to play a role.",ear poisoning
"But w hile our signer uses eyegaze instructively , he does not use child -directed sign.",ear poisoning
Eyegaze .,ear poisoning
"Joint attention is defined as an observer following the eyegaze of an interactant to a target (C ORKUM , & MOORE , 1995).",ear poisoning
"It is important for a successful SRA, particularly for deaf children (S WANWICK , & WATSON , 2007) or children with language -related special needs (K ADERAVEK , &JUSTICE , 2002).",ear poisoning
"Discussions of joint attention usually concern live 166 Revi sta Sinalizar, v.1, n.2, p. 152 -178, jul./dez.",ear poisoning
2016 interactions.,ear poisoning
"However, addressee s visually attend to a video narrators gestures if the narrator holds a gesture or gazes at her own gesture (G ULLBERG , & H OLMQVIST , 2006).",ear poisoning
"Also, deaf preschoolers learn ASL from interacting with a screen character (H UANG , et al., 2008) , and show improved literacy -related engagement behaviors after watching educ ational sign videos (GOLOS, 2010), both of which results presume joint attention.",ear poisoning
"A t least six types of eyegaze identified in sign literature (KANEKO , & MESCH , 2013) potentially foster/scaffold joint attention , and all are used by our signers : (1) narrators gaze at the audience.",ear poisoning
Our signer opens with this and uses it often.,ear poisoning
(2) characters gaze.,ear poisoning
An example is when Santa looks around the house (0:57).,ear poisoning
(3) spotl ight gaze on hand(s).,ear poisoning
The signer alternates between narrators and spotlight gaze as he describes the stockings (0:29 -0:46).,ear poisoning
"(4) reactive gaze on hands, showing how the signer feels toward what the hands tell .",ear poisoning
This is in the two clip s about what the narrator see s when he opens the window (1:39 -1:47) and discovers a miniature sleight and ei ght reindeers (1:48 -1:57 the reactive gaze ends at 1:55).,ear poisoning
"(5) panoptic gaze , where the eyes add information to manual signs .",ear poisoning
"When the narrator hears hoof beats on the roof, his eyes go upward and right , indicat ing the sounds source ( 3:01).",ear poisoning
"(6) prescient gaze , indicating future action by anticipatory looking.",ear poisoning
We find it in the clip corresponding to And away they all f lew like the down of a thistle (5:00 -5:04).,ear poisoning
"At the end, the signer raises his eyes, and at the beginning of the next clip, he rides off in his sleigh.",ear poisoning
"Thus the signers eyes establish joint attention by looking directly at the camera, inviting the reader to return direct gaze , and by looking at a target, pulling the readers eyes toward it .",ear poisoning
Child -directed signing .,ear poisoning
"Some have argued that child -directed speech (with exagger ated prosody ) helps small children learn words ( mean age of 30 months; see GOLINKOFF , et al.",ear poisoning
", 1992).",ear poisoning
"Further, exaggerated pitch differences in child -directed speech help preschool ers interpret others emotions ( QUAM , & S WINGLEY , 2012).",ear poisoning
"S o we might expect child -directed signing (again, studied mostly with respect to preschoolers) during SRAs to h elp children gain vocabulary and better understand characters emotions in stories .",ear poisoning
"Child -directed signing by deaf parents uses larger, slower, more repetitious signing (that is, with lexical -internal repetition) , as well as signing on the childs body or displacement of signs to within the childs visual field (HOLZRICHTER , & M EIER , 2000 ) all of which help direct the childs attention to the language act.",Caring
In this ebook many signs are large and slow .,Caring
"167 Revi sta Sinalizar, v.1, n.2, p. 152 -178, jul./dez.",Caring
"2016 However, the size and rate of signing correspond to narrative structure , not visual salience of individual signs.",Caring
"In general, our signer places ve rbs toward the end of a clip, a nd often they are larger and slower .",Caring
"But nothing about his signing suggests it is child -directed, not the type of repetitions nor the lexical items used (and see H OLZRICHTER ,& M EIER , 2000 ).Instead, our signer helps develop vocabulary by using signs in isolation or in brief utterances as well as stressing signs (by lengthened duration and increased size (DE TEMPLE , & SNOW , 2003, p. 18).",Caring
"But he keeps in mind pleasure for b oth child and adult; o n an adult reader, child -directed language soon wears thin.",Caring
So the lack of child -directed language was an aesthetic judgment on our signers part .,Caring
These ebooks are not intended for the child to use alone (althou gh they can be ).,Caring
"They are intended for child and adult together, so they must attract both .",Caring
"Only then will both eagerly reach for them , and only then will we find the kind of language interaction we seek to encourage.",Caring
"Use of th e ebooks at home and at school Thus far, we have underscored the childs enjoyment and shown through examination of one of our ebook show they offer help in implicit development o f sign literacy skills and preparation for print literacy skills .",Caring
But w hat is the role of the adult in the SRA ?,Caring
"Many continue to propose that hearing parents need to be taught how to engage with their deaf children in SRAs , even SRAs that use bimodal -bilingual ebooks (DIRKS , & W AUTERS , 2015).",Caring
"We repeat our reasons for bein g skeptical: following guidelines may result in joyless lessons which stress the adult, and, hence, the child .",Caring
"If both parent and child are to want to repeat SRAs, both must enjoy it.",Caring
Weve selected the source books for our ebooks with both parent and ch ild in mind.,Caring
And our signers use signing that should be pleasing to both child and adult (they have a voided child -directed signing).,Caring
"We suggest, then, that parent and child can share these ebooks in whatever way they want.",Caring
The parent might simply read the text while the child looks at the videos.,Caring
The parent might point to illustrations and try to guess what part of the signing is describing the visuals that the illustrations are providing (such as the children snug in bed i n the Santa story) and then ask the child to make further guesses (perhaps about the loops of decorations on the mantelpiece).,Caring
The parent might imitate the actions in the story acting them out like a mime and invite the child to do the same.,Caring
The pare nt could copy the signer and encourage the child to do the same.,Caring
"168 Revi sta Sinalizar, v.1, n.2, p. 152 -178, jul./dez.",Caring
"2016 As signing knowledge grows, the parent and child could have conversations in sign about the story, and then about whats going to happen in their home on the next holiday, and then about whatever else they want.",Caring
"That is, interaction may be minimal or it may be prolonged and complex.",Caring
"So long as both parent and child are enjoying themselves, repeated sharings of the ebooks will almost assuredly result in improved signing skills for both, and in increased language interaction over the books, which cannot help but develop better understanding of narrative and characterization.",Caring
"That is, we hope that these unscripted and joyful SRAs will be as fruitful for the emergent deaf reader as unscripted and joyful SRAs are for the emergent h earing reader.",Caring
"And at the very least , parent and child will have fun together.",Caring
"Teachers of deaf children can help parents of deaf children by recommending these SRAs, and explicitly telling parents that there is no on e right way to use them.",Caring
They can give parents license to simply enjoy sharing a story with their child instead of constantly worrying about what their child is learning.,Caring
"Likewise, these ebooks can be shared in classrooms .",Caring
"While everyone knows that presc hoolers need SRAs ( even pediatricians recommend them; DUURSMA , AUGUSTYN , & ZUCKERMAN , 2008), elementary school children do, as well (G AMBRELL , 2011).",Caring
The classroom teacher must find the time in the school day to simpl y read with the children for pure pleasure .,Caring
"These ebooks offer that, with the superb side benefit s of exposure to a sign language and another culture , and the opportunity to discuss Deaf Culture and variations within the deaf community .",Caring
"The ebooks can be shared the same way ordinary pictu re books are shared at circle time, not just by teachers who have been trained to work with deaf children, but by any teacher, with any set of children.",Caring
"Deaf and hearin g children, alike, can enjoy the signing , simply watching it and talking about what they see.",Caring
"They can note the different shapes the hands can assume, the space the hands move around in, the ways the different parts of the face move.",Caring
"They can be encouraged to make up signs for objects that lend themselves to transparent visual represen tations like book, glass, tree, house then the teacher can look up the real signs in an online dictionary and the whole class can compare their made up signs to the real signs.",Caring
They can have fun imagining occasions in which it would be a huge benefit to be able to communicate with someone silently.,Caring
"If theres strong interest in a particular story, a follow -up activity might be acting out that story and, gradually, moving more a nd more toward signing it .",Caring
"169 Revi sta Sinalizar, v.1, n.2, p. 152 -178, jul./dez.",Caring

"When we tested the ebooks at schools for the deaf, in fall 2013 and 2014, we found several behaviors among the children.",learning 
"(1) T hey mimic the videos as they wat ch them repeatedly, even as of the second viewing.",learning 
"(2) In retelling , they vary the stories , exaggerating to show feelings or personal interests .",learning 
"(3) T hey tell the child next to them what the story is about, p reparing them for it.",learning 
"(4) They retell the ebooks together, as a gam e; one will elaborate on the others sentence .",learning 
(5) Throughout these behaviors they use higher level facilitative language techniques (such as asking open -ended questions and building off each others elaborations of the story) .,learning 
"These five charact eristics are typical of effecti ve SRAs (W HITEHURST , & ZEVENBERGEN , 2003).",learning 
"Additionally, we found the following two behaviors: (6) They play with signs and tra nsform them , claiming language ownership (B AHAN , 2006).",learning

"San Francisco: Jossey -Bass/Wiley, 2015. frontiersin Children's literature provides the opportunity for children to see both representations of themselves and of others in print and in pictures.",stories
"Not only can engaging with picture books develop key literacy and language skills and a love of reading, but reading (and/or being read) high quality books also has the potential to foster an appreciation and respect for oneself and others.",stories
"However, sometimes the diversity that exists in the real world is not represented wellor at allin books created for young children (Mendoza and Reese, 2001; Kama, 2004).",stories
"In this article we will discuss the lack of, and critical need for, children's books that portray Deaf1 characters from a cultural perspective.",stories
"We will also provide examples, from a sampling of children's picture books, of messages about deafness and deaf characters in text and illustrations (e.g., Golos and Moses, 2011; Golos et al., 2012).",stories
"Finally, we will highlight the implications for both hearing and d/Deaf children as well as parents and educators.Typically, when people think about deafness, they think about a person with a disability, that is, someone who is unable to do something (i.e., hear).",stories
"This represents a pathological perspective of deafness, which entails viewing deafness as a disability or as a condition that needs to be fixed with medical intervention (i.e., cochlear implants or hearing aids; e.g., Lane, 1992; Lane et al., 1996; Padden and Humphries, 2006).",stories
"Deaf studies scholars suggest an alternative view of deafness from a cultural perspective, in which the deaf person is seen a member of a minority population, the Deaf community, rich with their own language (i.e., American Sign Language or ASL) and culture (i.e., Deaf culture) (e.g., Lane et al., 1996).Prior to 1990, when researchers examined portrayal of characters with disabilities in media, deafness, similar to other disabilities, was stereotyped as a person, needing to be fixed, isolated, angry, in danger, and/or unable to function in daily life (e.g., Carlisle, 1998).",stories
It has only been recently that some have begun to compare portrayals of deafness for pathological vs. cultural perspectives.,stories
"Although there has been an increasing awareness of Deaf culture, evidence from empirical studies suggests that the pathological perspective prevails (Golos, 2010; Golos and Moses, 2011; Golos et al., 2012).",stories
"For example, we content analyzed the text and illustrations of 20 children's picture books published after 1990 and that included a main character who was deaf (Golos and Moses, 2011; Golos et al., 2012).",stories
"Results showed that the majority of messages related a pathological perspective of deafness (71% of messages in the text and 93% of the messages in the illustrations).Because of the prevalence of messages reflecting the pathological model of deafness, young readers may be more likely to experience books about deaf characters attending public schools and being mainstreamed with hearing children, as well as struggles they may face in such settings.",stories
"For example, more often they may learn about characters like Oliver who cannot hear and, as a result, is isolated until he receives his hearing aid (Riski and Klakow, 2001).Although cultural portrayals exist in children's literature, characters like Oliver dominate the literature.",stories
"We found that the most common pathologically-oriented messages included references to fixing the character's deafness and having a greater ability to function or an improved quality of life after receiving amplification (e.g., hearing aid or cochlear implant) (Golos and Moses, 2011; Golos et al., 2012).Another recurring message involved the deaf child in danger.",stories
"For example, in one picture book, there is concern that a deaf character might get hit by a car because the character could not hear (Roth, 2000).",stories
"In another story, an elementary-aged deaf child gets upset and runs into an elevator, does not know how to use it and gets stuck.",stories
"Other characters are concerned because the boy cannot hear their verbal instructions (Watkins, 1993).",stories
"Similar to the disability literature, these, and other similar messages found in the sample, perpetuate a stereotype of a deaf child as needing to be fixed or needing help to function in everyday situations (Carlisle, 1998; Golos and Moses, 2011; Golos et al., 2012).Although the sample was small, there were very few cultural messages found in the text and illustrations of the 20 picture books analyzed.",stories
"One of the few examples comes from the Moses series, in which the deaf character, Moses, attends a school for the deaf and everyone signs (including his family).",stories
"When his mother asks Moses how his first day of school was he responds, I have 10 classmates and all ten are my friends (Millman, 2000, p. 27).",stories
"Additional examples included aspects of the Deaf community (e.g., attending a Deaf theater production), or Deaf characters using flashing lights, and other cultural technologies used in everyday situations (i.e., without medical intervention) (e.g., Millman, 2000; Tildes, 2006).However, it should be noted that books conveying more of a pathological perspective also contained some positive messages.",stories
"For example, some books included messages related to positive relationships between the deaf child and his/her parent(s).",stories
"In Moonbird (Dunbar, 2007), the parents learn the importance of communication and valuing their deaf child for who he is, and in Dad and Me in the Morning (Larkin, 1994), a hearing father and his deaf child bond while watching the sunrise.",stories
"Moments such as these represent the critical connection between family members and their deaf child.One reason the pathological perspective dominates may be due to an increase in medical technology, such as cochlear implants.",stories
"As a result, deaf children are increasingly mainstreamed into general education settings or placed in self-contained classrooms.",stories
"However, in these settings, a deaf child often has limited interactions with other deaf children and/or Deaf adults, may not be taught or encouraged to use ASL and the classrooms often lack staff and/or resources to teach about Deaf culture.Recent evidence suggests that deaf children, regardless of use of amplification, benefit from exposure to visual language such as ASL (e.g., Mayberry, 2007, 2010) and exposure to culturally Deaf role models (e.g., Holcomb, 1997).",stories
Deaf community members and national organizations for the Deaf (http://www.nad.org/issues/education/k-12/position-statement-schools-deaf) support schools for the deaf that offer access to ASL and Deaf culture as the preferred setting for most deaf children.,stories
"However, for the increasing number of children not attending these schools, there may be a greater need for positive Deaf role models and positive messages about ASL.",stories
Utilizing children's picture books is one way to do so.,stories
They also can offer the hearing population messages to promote understanding and respect for d/Deaf people.,stories
"However, to do so, they must contain accurate information about the Deaf community and Deaf culture.Ultimately, picture books could have considerable impact on children's perceptions of themselves and others.",stories
"If hearing children read (or are read) picture books that present a pathological view, they may learn that deafness is a disability, that a deaf person struggles in daily life, and that medical fixes are necessary in order for a deaf person to be happy, able to function, and be accepted.",stories
"For the Deaf child, such depictions may cultivate a sense of inadequacy and/or low sense of self regarding who they are and what they can do.",stories
"She/he may also feel the need to be fixed.If, on the other hand, picture books portray a cultural perspective of Deaf people, then deaf and hearing children could learn that Deaf culture exists and thrives and learn more about the language, history and values that are distinct from the hearing population.",stories
"Through exposure and discussion about picture book messages, the hearing population could even serve as advocates for preserving the Deaf child's language and culture.",stories
"Deaf readers may see that, like the main character in the Moses series, they can go to a school where Deaf teachers use sign language (e.g., ASL) and can learn to enjoy the arts, athletics, and academics utilizing their strengths in a visual language (e.g., ASL) and in a visual environment.",stories
"This may promote a feeling of pride and help develop a strong sense of self.Too often, being different from the majority is depicted negatively.",stories
"Deaf studies scholars have coined the term Deaf Gain as a way of looking at the Deaf community from a perspective of benefit rather than loss (Bauman and Murray, 2009).",stories
"That is, viewing deaf individuals as providing a unique to contribution to his/her community and broader society.",stories
"Most notable are the visual ways of being (Bahan, 2009), including communicating through a visual language (e.g., ASL) and designing visual environments (lots of light, seats arranged in a way that everyone can see one another, etc.",stories
").To help promote the concept of Deaf Gain in children's picture books, we encourage parents and teachers to incorporate books with cultural messages into their classrooms, and discuss these cultural messages.",stories
"Recent examples, in addition to the Moses series, include new eBooks from Deaf authors/illustrators such as the Zoey Goes series.",stories
"According to their website, the goal of their eBooks is for deaf children to see themselves and for hearing children to learn about a linguistic minority (zoeygoes.com).",stories
"Parents and teachers can capitalize on these messages by discussing with children (hearing or deaf) how deaf people benefit from and access visual ways of being, such as using a light to get their dogs attention instead of calling him.",stories
"However, there remains a need for high quality literature that incorporates more of these types of messages.When pathological messages are present, educators should take the time to discuss them.",stories
"For example, after reading the book about the deaf boy who gets stuck in the elevator, adults might ask children if they think that situation is realistic.",stories
"Or, they might present examples of how all children can use visual strategies (that deaf individuals use) to do things, such as cross the street.",stories
"Finally, children can learn that all deaf children, regardless of their use of medical technology or background can have friends, have skills and talents to share with others, and can lead meaningful lives.As an area for future research, we suggest that children's picture books be examined for their quality.",stories
"After examining some of the storylines and themes of children's picture books with deaf characters, one might question whether these stories would have been published if the characters were not deaf.",stories
"For instance, would a story be published about an elementary-aged hearing child who did not know how to use an elevator?",deaf
"Although an empirical examination is needed to examine the quality of current literature, teachers should review storylines and messages in books before choosing to incorporate them in their classrooms.",deaf
"The ultimate goal is to choose books that are worthy of children's time and attention that help develop their early literacy skills, and that provide important and accurate information about diverse populations.Children's picture books hold the promise to promote awareness and appreciation.",deaf
"Yet in order to do this, diverse populations should be depicted positively and accurately.",deaf
"Picture books can portray Deaf Gain through images, fictional stories, biographies and other genres that portray the unique qualities and advantages of visual ways of being rather than the loss of hearing.",deaf
"However, even when alternate messages are present these topics should still be discussed with children so they develop an awareness and appreciation in hearing readers as well as pride and connection to Deaf culture and the Deaf Community in d/Deaf readers.Just as our own favorite picture book from childhood stays with us through the years, so may the other characters and messages portrayed in picture books that display diverse people and diverse ways of being.",deaf
"Picture books have the potential to influence our thoughts, perceptions and identity, and choosing and discussing picture books for young children provides daily opportunities to inspire and enlighten.",deaf
"Ideally, books chosen for children should foster these positive outcomes creating both an immediate and lasting positive impression of themselves and others.",deaf

"Early Reading for Young Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children: Alternative Frameworks AbstractDeaf children can develop reading skills by using a visual language tobridge meaning to English print without the use of English auditory phonology.To this end, five deafcentric frameworks are described that take into accountthe use of visual language and visual learning, as well as the use of deafcultural role models in the teaching of reading.",hard hearing
"Moving away from the deficitmodel, these frameworks focus on Deaf1 students in the act of reading in orderto document their actual behaviors using a bilingual American SignLanguage/English philosophy.",hard hearing

"A New Lens to Look at Deaf ReadersA deaf doctoral student commented, How many more English tests do hearing people have to give deaf children before they know deaf students have English deficiencies?",hard hearing
Dont we already know this?,hard hearing
"Conventional reading research in deaf education has taken the stance of a deficit approach, as it repeatedly catalogues the deficits in English phonological, vocabulary, and syntax typically found with deaf readers.",hard hearing
"As this deaf graduate student noted, how many more studies do we need?",hard hearing
"Challenged by her question and with her joining us in a deaf-hearing partnership, we propose a different approach, one that looks at deaf childrens reading problems through the lens of critical pedagogy, and concludes with the notion of building fault tolerant systems that analyze systemic failures.A recent study by Cupples, Ching, Crowe, Day, and Seeto (2014) evaluating deaf children using spoken language led us to conduct a review of alternative frameworks for early reading, created for signing deaf students.",hard hearing
"These frameworks move away from a deficit model, but may not critically assess or propose new solutions for all deaf children.",hard hearing
"These alternative frameworks focus on deaf students in the act of reading, and document their actual reading behaviors to build more effective strategies.",hard hearing
"These frameworks were developed so that deaf readers would be successful, using more top-down strategies rather than focusing on bottom-up strategies.",hard hearing
"Given that there are multiple pathways which can lead to successful reading for deaf bilinguals ( Allen, Letteri, Choi, & Dang, 2014 ; Andrews & Mason, 1986 ; Freel et al., 2011 ), we conclude this line of reasoning with a challenge to develop fault tolerant approaches that explore, permit, and encourage multiple pathways for all deaf readers to become successful.",hard hearing
"These paths tend to challenge and avoid bottom-up drill as the most efficacious strategy for learning to read.Overall, classroom observations and research on deaf readers find that even young deaf children, with limited proficiencies in both American Sign Language (ASL) and English, when learning to read take advantage of signing and fingerspelling ( Andrews & Mason, 1986 ; Andrews, 2012 ).",hard hearing
These findings are in contrast to traditional approaches to early reading instruction and frameworks that have been designed for deaf students.,hard hearing
"The proposed alternative frameworks involve visual language, including ASL, printed texts, and visual processing.",hard hearing
"Visual processing strategies focus on visual learning, where learning is processed through the eye and can include visual engagement strategies such as visual attention, gaze behaviors, visual joint attention (see reviews in Baker, 2011 ; Hirshorn, 2011 ; Lieberman, Hatrak, & Mayberry, 2011 ), as well as the use of pictures, illustration, drawings, print, movies, and visual media ( Kuntze, Golos, & Enns, 2014 ).2.",hard hearing
"The Big PictureDespite decades of teaching and research, the basic process of how deaf children transform print into thought without full access to language is not fully understood (see Marschark & Everhart (1997) for a treatise on the relation between language and thought).",hard hearing
Like the Cupples et al.,hard hearing
"(2014) perspective, some researchers believe that comprehending the auditory phonological structure of words ( Geers & Hayes, 2011 ; Luckner, Sebald, Cooney, Young, & Muir, 2005 ; Trezek & Mayer, 2015 ; Paul, Wang, Trezek, & Luckner, 2009 ) is a key factor in deaf childrens early literacy difficulties.",hard hearing
"This approach has gained momentum and has been applied to early literacy learning as more deaf and hard of hearing children have access to the phonology of English with cochlear implants or digital hearing aids (see for example, Johnson & Goswami, 2010 ; Montag, AuBuchon, Pisoni, & Kronenberger, 2014 ).",hard hearing
"However, Mayberry, del Giudice and Lieberman (2011) counter-argue that language, not phonological awareness, is the key variable to reading for deaf students.",hard hearing
"They provided a meta-analysis of studies that showed that phonological awareness accounted for 11% of the variance, with a greater percentage of the variance being explained by reading comprehension.",hard hearing
"Importantly, 35% of the variance was explained by overall language proficiency.",hard hearing
"Similarly, Geers and Hayes (2011) noted that deaf children with CIs had higher performance on more global literacy measures than on phonological processing tasks, suggesting to them that visual processing strategies provided alternative routes to reading.",hard hearing
"Moreover, Clark, Gilbert and Anderson (2011) found the phonological awareness was not related to reading skills; some participants had near perfect phonology and weak reading skills while others were reading at the post-secondary levels with almost no phonological skills.",hard hearing
"Given this findings as well as other published work (e.g., Freel et al., 2011 ; Miller & Clark, 2011 ), we do not fully understand whether phonological skills are acquired after the development of reading skills, in contrast to the idea that phonological skills are precursors to becoming a skilled reader.What we do know is that compared to hearing children, it takes deaf children longer to learn to read, often three to four years and sometimes even longer ( Hoffmeister & Caldwell-Harris, 2014 ), with many youth plateauing at the fourth grade level even after nine or more years of education ( Traxler, 2000 ).",hard hearing
"Such low reading achievement levels are found worldwide with deaf children learning to read both alphabetic and logographic scripts ( Liu, Liu, & Andrews, 2014 ; Qi & Mitchell, 2011 ; Wang, Paul, & Lee, 2010 ).",hard hearing
"We also know that many deaf children do learn to read early, particularly those who have deaf parents ( Lieberman, Hatrak, & Mayberry, 2011 ; Herbold, 2008 ).",hard hearing
"The aspects of reading that we do understand are related to observable factors such as the demographic characteristics of deaf children, including their early access to spoken and sign languages, as well as supportive parents.",hard hearing
"Still there is ample documentation on the challenges deaf children face with the linguistic features of texts at the word, phrase, clause, sentences, and discourse levels ( Paul & Wang, 2012 ).2.1.",hard hearing
"Reading Difficulties for Deaf ChildrenAs deaf children progress in school, they often have difficulty with comprehending morphemes ( Nielsen, Luetke, & Stryker, 2011 ), and acquiring and comprehending vocabulary (particularly multiple meaning words (see reviews in Paul et al., 2009 ).",hard hearing
"In addition, there are problems in comprehension including; figurative language ( Rittenhouse & Stearns, 1990 ), verb particles ( Payne & Quigley, 1987 ), syntax ( Kelly, 1996 ) and accessing world knowledge ( Convertino et al., 2014 ).",hard hearing
"Importantly, as these types of linguistic and cognitive structures are often the foundation of childrens books, the problems make reading complicated for these deaf children.",hard hearing
"For example, Sugiura (2012) used Family Circle comic strips to test elementary aged deaf childrens reading skills.",hard hearing
"These children were reading below the second grade level and were found to have difficulty understanding the meaning of punctuation marks, such as quotation marks in dialogue, verb contractions, ellipses, and exclamation marks.",hard hearing
"These types of findings highlight the cognitive, grammatical and reading fluency difficulties typical of many deaf readers.There are several other issues that often are problematic in deaf childrens reading development.",hard hearing
"Effective eye gaze synchrony ( Clark et al., 2015 ), the development of joint attention strategies ( Lieberman et al., 2011 ), and parent/child storybook reading ( Andrews & Zmijewski, 1997 ; Berke, 2013 ; Lartz, 1999 ) are often missing in hearing families that are not using a visual language.",hard hearing
These issues mentioned above often limit parent involvement in literacy activities in the home.,hard hearing
"These gaps in early interactions between a child and their parents with print and books can therefore delay and limit literacy outcomes ( Andrews & Mason, 1986 ; Andrews & Zmijewski, 1997 ; Bailes, Erting, Erting, & Thumann-Prezioso, 2009 ; Berke, 2013 ; Watson & Swanwick, 2008 ; Williams, 2004 ).",hard hearing
All of these cognitive and linguistic developmental issues create problems for many deaf children as they learn to read.2.2.,hard hearing
"Factors That Impact Literacy and Deaf ChildrenThe key factor for deaf childs reading is early and full language access, whether the language is auditory or visual, ( Goldin-Meadow & Mayberry, 2001 ; Mayberry, Lock, & Kazmi, 2002 ; Mayberry et al., 2011 ; Pnicaud et al., 2013 ).",hard hearing
"Limiting the deaf child to only auditory pathways for language learning is risky, even with newer auditory technologies, such as digital hearing aids and cochlear implants, as they may not provide full access to auditory language.",hard hearing
"Therefore, these children need exposure to language models in both visual and auditory modalities from the time hearing loss is detected, to take full advantage of the sensitive period for language learning (see reviews in Humphries et al., 2014 ; Kuhl & Rivera-Gaxiola, 2008 ; Kushalnagar et al., 2010 ).ASL is a natural language, which has all the properties of spoken languages, with fundamentally different linguistic and grammatical structures ( Andrews, Leigh, & Weiner, 2004 ).",hard hearing
"Moreover, ASL occurs in a different modality (Traxler, 2012).",hard hearing
"Despite these differences, the brain does not differentiate between signed languages or spoken languages and children acquire either, or both, if the languages are provided in the environment ( Petitto, 2009 ; Petitto et al., 2012 ).",hard hearing
"Given that 95% of all deaf children are born to hearing parents, access to visual language is often not provided ( Andrews, Leigh, & Weiner, 2004 ).",hard hearing
"This choice of only presenting spoken language to a deaf child may not provide sufficient linguistic input to allow typical cortical development ( Pnicaud et al., 2013 ) or the acquisition of typical linguistic milestones (Andrews, Logan, & Phelan, 2008).",hard hearing
"Recent research on bimodal bilingual children (those who had exposure to both spoken and sign languages) with cochlear implants found that exposure to early sign language lead to increases in spoken language skills when compared to cochlear implant children without sign exposure (Hassanzadel, 2012).2.3.",hard hearing
Reading Models for Deaf ChildrenCurriculums developed to teach hearing children to read have been used to teach deaf children to read and most of them focus on auditory phonology.,hard hearing
Stanovich (2000) focuses on reading problems related to phonological sensitivity in hearing individuals.,hard hearing
"His theory is used in the Qualitative Similarity Hypothesis (see Paul, Wang, & Williams, 2013).",hard hearing
"The Simple View of Reading emphasizes both decoding and comprehension to explain reading difficulties ( Gough & Tunmer, 1986 ); these ideas can be seen for deaf readers in Easterbrooks et al.",hard hearing
(2015) .,hard hearing
"Others have utilized Masons top-down model, which underscores the importance of reading whole stories to preliterate children to help them make connections to early reading ( Mason, 1980 ) and is found in the work of Andrews and her colleagues ( Andrews, 2012 ; Andrews & Mason, 1986 ; Andrews, Winograd, & Deville, 1994 ).",hard hearing
"Still others focus on the bilingual acquisition of ASL and English ( Allen, Letteri, Choi, & Dang, 2014 ; Hoffmeister & Caldwell-Harris, 2014 ; Kuntz, Golos, & Enns, 2014 ; McQuarrie & Parrila, 2014 ; Supalla, Wix, & McKee, 2001 ) rather than applying traditional reading models developed for hearing children.",hard hearing
These theoretical perspectives are expanded below.2.4.,hard hearing
"Qualitative Similarity HypothesisA view articulated by Paul (2013) , as well as Trezek and Mayer (2015) , labeled the Qualitative Similarity Hypotheses (QSH), is that deaf children go through the same process as their hearing peers in learning to read, even if they are delayed in their reading milestones.",hard hearing
"Here, visual and auditory tools developed by educators for hearing children are added to provide deaf children access to auditory phonemic awareness and the alphabetic principle ( Paul & Wang, 2012 ).",hard hearing
"One augmentative technique is speech reading, but only 30% of English phonemes can be visually distinguished on the lips ( Andrews et al., 2004 ) making the technique ineffective for full comprehension.",hard hearing
"Another tool is that of the use of articulatory feedback ( Seifert et al., 2002 ), which is also limited by the amount of speech the child can hear, with or without cochlear implants and/or digital hearing aids.",hard hearing
"To overcome these limitations, Cued Speech was developed ( Cornett, 1967 ) and consists of eight hand shapes or cues (representing consonants) at four different locations around the mouth (representing vowel sounds).",hard hearing
These cues and mouth positions are used in combination with residual hearing and the visual information from speech reading to make the phonemes of English visible to the deaf child.,hard hearing
"A more recent system, called Visual Phonics (International Communication Learning Institute, 1996), is being used in deaf education and consists of 46 manual representations or hand gestures, with the 45 written symbols that correspond to the 45 phonemes of English, with a 46th hand gesture used to indicate the silent e. Each mouth movement is paired with a hand gesture to represent a single phoneme of English ( Paul & Wang, 2012 ).",hard hearing
"These visual markings are hypothesized to make English phonology available to deaf children, and allow them to develop reading skills in similar ways to their hearing peers, but often at a delayed rate.Easterbrooks and her colleagues ( Easterbrooks et al., 2015 ) also believe that auditory phonological awareness is important and follow the Simple View of Reading (SVR) ( Gough & Tunmer, 1986 ), which emphasizes that decoding skills and oral language development are needed for reading to take place.",hard hearing
"Here the use of fingerspelling was included in the model, but only in relationship to mapping onto the letters of the alphabet.In sum, the QSH researchers ( Easterbrooks et al., 2015 ; LaSasso & Crain, 2015 ; Paul, 2013 ; Trezek & Mayer, 2015 ) collectively suggest that both language-related and auditory code-related skills are needed for reading development.",hard hearing
"Each propose that proficiency in face-to-face communication of the target language (English), including its phonological aspects (whether presented auditorily or visually) are critical for the literacy development of deaf children.2.5.",hard hearing
"Visual Language Learning & Mapping Sign/Fingerspelling to PrintPattern recognition of the smallest units of language is a skill that all language learners must learn, whether these be auditory sounds or units that are represented visually and tactilely through speechreading, articulatory feedback, Visual Phonics, Cued Speech, signs, fingerspelling or written letters (Andrews & Wang, 2015).",hard hearing
"In contrast to the above researchers who focus on auditory phonology, some researchers connect meaning to print by using visual phonology and sign orthography.",hard hearing
"This strategy goes directly from print to meaning ( Allen et al., 2014 ).",hard hearing
Here visual phonology (or alternative visually based ASL phonology or visual sign phonology) is the mechanism used to learn to read.,identities of deaf
"This visual segmentation provides the prosodic and suprasegmental structure of signs, signed sentences, fingerspelling, and the orthographic patterns of letters.",identities of deaf
"Allen (2015) studied 251 deaf children, ages 3 to 7 who had severe to profound hearing losses, examining the impact of early visual language on early literacy, cognition, and social adjustment.",identities of deaf
"He found that when fingerspelling skills were controlled for, ASL showed an independent effect on letter knowledge.",identities of deaf
"Here, ASL skills were interpreted as being derived from a visually based phonological process that transfers to the learning of letters and an orthographically based system of sub-lexical units that can combine to form words and can occur independently of letter-sound knowledge as well as fingerspelling.",identities of deaf
"Therefore, both ASL receptive skills and fingerspelling skills were strongly and independently related to childrens alphabetic knowledge (see Figure 1).",identities of deaf
Allen and colleagues concluded that readingFigure 1.,identities of deaf
"Path model showing impacts of age, ASL Receptive Skill, and Fingerspelling Skill on letter knowledge using a say or sign task.can be qualitatively similar to hearing children, if it is presented in forms that are modality independent, i.e., visually ( Allen et al., 2014: p. 355 ).",identities of deaf
In addition Allen et al.,identities of deaf
"(2015) found that among the three, four, and five years old within their database who had parents who used ASL, these children had the highest levels of letter knowledge.",identities of deaf
This effect to a lesser extent was also found with children whose parents were only beginning to learn to sign.,identities of deaf
"Children whose parents used only spoken language had the lowest levels on pre-literacy measures.Another model based on visual language and visual learning is called the Functional Equivalency Model ( McQuarrie & Parilla, 2014 ).",identities of deaf
This model asserts that there are some aspects of reading for deaf people that are similar to that of hearing readers.,identities of deaf
"However, their work suggests that deaf readers crack the orthographic code in fundamentally different ways than do their hearing peers.",identities of deaf
"Their findings show that deaf readers were insensitive to the auditory phonological structure of words at the syllabic, rhyming, and phonemic levels.",identities of deaf
Similar to the model proposed by Allen et al.,identities of deaf
"(2014) , these authors concluded that factors of sign language and print orthography contribute to the reading processes of deaf children, and replace auditory phonology.Related to the visual nature of the models of Allen et al.",identities of deaf
"(2014) and McQuarrie and Parilla (2014) , other work shows that visual pattern recognition of larger chunks of letters is also important.",identities of deaf
"For example, deaf children who learn the print letter patterns of morphemes, which are highly regular, use these patterns as another visual learning strategy when learning to read ( Nunes & Bryant, 2006 ).",identities of deaf
"They used materials based on morpheme teaching, linking their work to that with hearing children.",identities of deaf
"Numes and Bryants participants, after given morpheme instruction, had significantly higher understanding of using suffixes in spelling, word reading, reading comprehension and writing skills.",identities of deaf
"Similar findings by Nielsen, Luetke, and Stryker (2011) show the importance of morphemic awareness for supporting reading development for deaf children.2.6.",identities of deaf
Three-Stage Descriptive Model Hoffmeister and Caldwell-Harris (2014) propose another model grounded in visual language and visual learning.,identities of deaf
"In their model, deaf children can become skilled readers, through reading and writing of English print.",identities of deaf
They state that the phonology of English is not necessary.,identities of deaf
"The authors emphasize that is it not deafness per se that causes reading difficulties, but a lack of full access to a visual language.",identities of deaf
This lack of access to visual language causes the inherent difficulties deaf children have in acquiring language when they cannot practice it outside of the school activities of reading and writing.,identities of deaf
"In this model, there are three stages of learning that represent successive, conceptual insights for deaf children learning their second language (English) through print.",identities of deaf
"In the first stage of learning to read, deaf children learn how to map translations of familiar signs and sign phrases to print at the word and phrase level.",identities of deaf
"In stage 2, the children progress to mapping signs to words and sentences, including idioms, metaphors, and multiple meanings.",identities of deaf
"Then in stage 3, children use their bilingualism to learn additional English, through print in a bilingual, interactive learning mode ( Hoffmeister & Caldwell-Harris, 2014 ).",identities of deaf
"In this way, a strong foundation in sign language is used as the bridge to becoming bilingual in both sign and a later developed spoken language.2.7.",identities of deaf
"Whole to Part (Top down) ApproachRather than starting at the word/phrase level as proposed by Hoffmeister and Caldwell-Harris (2014) or focusing on letter knowledge as one indicator of emergent literacy ( Allen et al., 2014 ), a whole-to-part or top down model developed for hearing children was proposed by Mason and her colleagues ( Mason, Stewart, Peterman, & Dunning, 1992 ; McCormick & Mason, 1989, 1990 ) and was adapted for signing deaf children.",identities of deaf
"This model can explain reading picture phrase books ( Andrews & Mason, 1986 ), reading expository science texts ( Andrews & Mason, 1991 ) as well as reading fables using ASL summaries ( Andrews, Winograd, & Deville, 1994 ).",identities of deaf
"According to Mason and her colleagues, childrens earliest concepts about print and books are developed from their earliest experiences and interactions with storybook reading, environmental print and writing, as well as their own attempts to read, write, and make meanings from social interactions.",identities of deaf
"Early reading encompasses the awareness and experiences with reading, writing, speaking, listening and thinking, all of which occurred in the home prior to children starting the formal instruction of conventional literacy in the first grade.",identities of deaf
"This view of reading is not only historical, but is still relevant today as researchers studying deaf children continue to use these emergent literacy frameworks ( Herbold, 2008 ; see reviews in Trezek & Mayer, 2015 ; Williams, 2004 ).",identities of deaf
"These recent works show that signing deaf children by age five can identify environmental print, write their names, fingerspell their names, write most, if not all, of the alphabet, and recite back elements of storybooks after being read to ( Herbold, 2008 ; Williams, 2004 ).",identities of deaf
"This framework includes four components, listed and explained below.1) Concepts and functions of literacy include knowledge of terms that are used to talk about reading.",identities of deaf
"Here understanding the functions of print, knowing how the act of reading is carried out (i.e.",identities of deaf
"knowing where to begin, and how to continue reading by turning pages), how to separate speech into words, syllables, and letters become the foundations of literacy.",identities of deaf
"Then, being able to track a line of print and ones self-perceptions about reading are important components of becoming a reader.",identities of deaf
"Finally, context-sensitive strategies for word reading and knowledge of environment print in familiar contexts allow the child to become literate.",identities of deaf
These functions are top-down and provide the big picture about reading.2) Knowledge of letters and words functions as the bottom-up support for becoming literate.,identities of deaf
"This knowledge includes letter knowledge, phonological awareness of beginning and ending sounds in words, grapheme- phoneme correspondence knowledge, and word recognition of common words and words containing generalizable patterns.3) Listening comprehension and word understanding again brings in whole-to-part strategies and includes complete or partial retelling of stories, defining, classifying, drawing analogies to words, and developing multiple strategies for reading texts.4) Writing and composing moves into the written forms of literacy, focusing on word writing, sentence dictation, and story composition.Here even though word identification and word decoding are important, the point being made is that early reading is more comprehensive than phonological awareness and vocabulary.",identities of deaf
"By extension to deaf children, early reading does not start at the one sign to one word mapping event, but can be initiated when a whole story or passage is presented in easy-to-read books with pictures, through signing conversations children have with adults, or with short passages of texts.Using a top-down reading model, as these studies suggest, is supported by research ( Supalla, Hauser, & Bavelier, 2014 ) in the short-term memory processes of deaf children and deaf adults who are fluent signers.",identities of deaf
"On a recall task using ASL sentences, fluent signers (both children and adults) used top-down scaffolding in their working memory to retrieve the meaning of the ASL sentences.",identities of deaf
"In contrast, deaf signers who were not fluent in sign used more linear strategies and visuospatial memory to imitate signed words.",identities of deaf
"Additionally, they recalled lexical signs in linear order and omitted function words.",identities of deaf
"Given these findings, Andrews and her colleagues suggest that to focus on early reading at the word-sign mapping or fingerspelling/decoding process is to miss the larger picture of what real readers dothe reading of complete texts, whether they are language experience stories, simple easy-to-read picture books, or more complex texts.2.8.",identities of deaf
"The Five-Component ModelAnother model is based on visual language and visual learning; the theoretical underpinning is based on the literature about multiliteracies and the sociocultural view of literacy ( Kuntze, Golos, & Enns, 2014 ).",identities of deaf
"This model is an alternative pathway, as reading comprehension is not only based on language acquisition and emergent literacy skills, but also learning a new language (ASL) as part of this process.",identities of deaf
"This early reading model includes five components: ASL acquisition and visual engagement, emergent literacy, social mediation with English print, literacy and Deaf culture, and finally multimedia activities.",identities of deaf
"It also includes the use of indigenous practices by deaf parents within their signing families; these interactions socialize deaf children into becoming readers ( Kuntze et al., 2014 ).",identities of deaf
"Their model suggests that the signing deaf children acquire reading through the visual modality, without access to spoken language, and that reading instruction should reflect these visual ways of learning.2.9.",identities of deaf
ASL Sign WritingThe last model that uses visual language is one that develops reading instruction by having deaf children learn to read ASL graphemes and ASL glosses.,identities of deaf
"Glossing is a written notation system devised to represent ASL ( Supalla & Cripps, 2011 ).",identities of deaf
In the first stages children learn to match pictures of objects with pictures of manual signs.,identities of deaf
"Then deaf children are taught a new writing system, which uses graphemes that represent the visual phonology of signs, including their hand shape, movement and location.",identities of deaf
"In the third stage, children are taught to read English glosses for ASL signs, which is called ASL glossing.",identities of deaf
"Supalla and colleagues use ASL gloss as an intermediary writing system, which links the childs ASL to English print.",identities of deaf
"There is an ASL Resource book, with gloss text written in what the authors call the ASL-phablet.",identities of deaf
"The ASL graphemes are written in a linear string to create sign equivalents of English words ( Supalla et al., 2001 ; Supalla & Cripps, 2011 ).2.10.",identities of deaf
SummaryThese visual perspectives are noteworthy because they focus on the language of the Deaf community to bridge meaning to English print without the use of English auditory phonology.,identities of deaf
"Moreover, reading instruction for English here involves using the linguistic structure of ASL to bridge meaning from one language to the other.",identities of deaf
Not yet available is a strong science base to determine if these top-down models for deaf children are a promising avenue for learning to read.,identities of deaf
So far these visual models suggest that there is more involved in learning to read than only bottom up strategies based on spoken language teaching curriculums.We do not dispute the fact that hearing loss exists along a continuum.,identities of deaf
Ninety-five percent of deaf children have hearing parents.,identities of deaf
"Many deaf children have some residual hearing, which permits access to auditory process- ing strategies and other auditory cognitive processing strategies to comprehend print, especially if they have cochlear implants or digital hearing aids ( Marschark et al., 2015 ).",identities of deaf
"However, in view of the documented delay of the language and early literacy of young deaf children using auditory methods to teach reading ( Cupples et al., 2014 ), we think that alternative approaches using signs and fingerspelling are warranted, given the accumulating data showing the early sign language acquisition facilitates the development of early reading ( Allen, 2015 ; Clark et al., 2016 ; Freel et al., 2011 ; Mayberry et al., 2011 ; Pnicaud et al., 2013 ).As such, the five visual frameworks we present are united in that they suggest that all deaf children can be bilingual, where both ASL and fingerspelling can be used to become literate in English.",identities of deaf
"Furthermore, they support the notion that the rhythmic and statistical regularities of ASL and fingerspelling have a facilitating role, in that it gives deaf children another tool, visual phonology, to use as a bridge to the learning of English ( Kuhl & Rivero-Gaxiola, 2008 ; Mayberry et al., 2011 ).2.11.",identities of deaf
"Suggestions for an Alternative ParadigmThese five deafcentric frameworks focus on the visual language of ASL and visual learning, as well as the use of Deaf cultural role models in the teaching of reading.",identities of deaf
"These models warrant consideration in future research because too many deaf childrens academic success has not improved for decades ( Johnson, Liddell, & Erting, 1989 ; Qi & Mitchell, 2011 ).",identities of deaf
"Creating a Fault Tolerant System in the schools and home, as proposed by Treisman (1992, 2013) , therefore, would be worth trying.In developing his ideas, Treisman (1992) was attempting to reverse the failure of African American students in STEM fields (especially calculus) at Berkley.",identities of deaf
Treiman wanted to understand why different environments lead to success while others lead to failure.,identities of deaf
"He suggests we focus on environments that create Fault Tolerant Systems, where individuals are able to absorb problems and overcome them, rather than succumb to them.",identities of deaf
"These systems promote resiliency and allow community cultural wealth ( Yosso, 2005 ) to protect those from underrepresented groups to succeed.",identities of deaf
"If one looks at this kind of cultural capital, one finds strategies that are taught outside of the dominant culture to permit success.Deaf capital wealth includes using a visual language, visual learning, and successful Deaf adult role modelsleading to aspirational capital, which serves as a protective factor in the face of lower expectations from hearing members of the society ( Twitchell, Morford, & Hauser, 2015 ).",identities of deaf
"Some researchers have already incorporated visual language, visual learning and Deaf cultural role models, as in the five models discussed above, and others include visual language in the teaching of early reading ( Humphries, 2004 ; Humphries et al., 2014 ).Can the Triesman model lead us to a new perspective related to deaf children and their literacy and language development?",identities of deaf
"As we know young deaf children are experiencing the same overall levels of failure ( Allen, 1986 ; Marschark & Harris, 1996 ; Musselman, 2000 ) as those African American students who were Treismans focus.",identities of deaf
What might Treisman have to contribute to this evolution in deaf education from the current model to a fault tolerant system?,identities of deaf
"Treisman (1992) states that there are unequal opportunities to learn and therefore, one needs to develop magic bullet interventions where people can suspend belief about failure.",identities of deaf
We can create expectations and positive mindsets to allow us to instill survival skills.,identities of deaf
"We need to design educational environments where we search for those who are not well served and understand the factors that prohibit self-efficaciousness in families, teachers, and students.",identities of deaf
"One must have a universally connected system of support for it to be fault tolerant ( Treisman, 2013 ).",identities of deaf
"Here early interventions with deaf infants, as well as effective deaf education, qualify as a system that would benefit from a re-design.Parents could create another system; this system would include a deaf infant whose parents were taught how to develop and maintain eye gaze with their infant to develop strong attachment and reciprocal turn-taking ( Clark et al., 2015 ).",identities of deaf
Turn-taking is crucial as it underlies both social and language development and sets the stage for future learning between teachers and students.,identities of deaf
"Applying this model, medical and early intervention professionals would strongly suspect that these hearing parents would be unaware of how their own attention getting devices would not be effective with their deaf and hard of hearing infant.",identities of deaf
"Their goals would be for parents and their infant to have a strong start and learn how to regulate attention for later social-emotional, linguistic, and future learning interactions.",identities of deaf
"The focus might be on attention, rather than focusing on discussing a choice between signed or spoken language.",identities of deaf
The goal for this discussion would be to be sure that parents had a mechanism that allowed them to develop strong caregiver-infant bonds.,identities of deaf
"The parents and child could later decide on the best strategies for language choice, school choice, and how to have strong peer relationships for their deaf and hard of hearing child.Medical professionals, audiologists, early childhood educators, schools, and families, would work to be sure that the deaf and hard of hearing child was developing according to well-known linguistic, social-emotional, behavioral, and academic milestones.",identities of deaf
"The focus would be on visual language; i.e., being sure to allow the child to look for language, regardless if it was spoken or signed ( Clark et al., 2015 ).",identities of deaf
"This system would monitor the childs ongoing development, based on evidence-based practices in developmental psychology.",identities of deaf
"The system would be sure to provide all options to the family and the deaf and hard of hearing child, including research about how early signing with cochlear implants does not negatively impact spoken language development ( Hassanzadeh, 2012 ; Lyness, Woll, Campbell, & Cardin, 2013 ).",identities of deaf
"These professionals would recommend the best of all hearing technologies, language possibilities, and all possible educational options.",identities of deaf
The societal system would place the deaf and hard of hearing child in an environment that embraced differences and established a cultural perspective that focused on diversity and how all can contribute to the success of our world.2.12.,identities of deaf

How do you do?,Improve your English

This most often happens when shaking hands with someone for the first time.,Improve your English
It is easy to hear if this is the case: there will be no inflection at the end of the sentence.,Improve your English
"In this instance, the correct response is to repeat the question back to the asker in the same flat tone, How do you do?This is one of the respectful greeting examples you can use replying to someone you meet for the very first time.",Improve your English
"For example:When people meet, it is a common practice to shake hands.",Improve your English

"For example:To show your respect, you can also add the persons last name to your greeting words.",Improve your English

"Suitable situations include:If you are sending a job application or emailing an HR department about a role you would like to apply for, To the Hiring Manager is a very useful greeting.",Improve your English
"It is particularly helpful if you are emailing a generic company-wide info@ inbox because it signals that your message will be about a work opportunity, and immediately instructs whoever manages the inbox to forward your message to the HR department.If you know the name and title of someone you are sending a formal email to, it is better to begin the conversation with Dear Mr [surname] instead of Dear sir or madam.In rare cases, the person you are emailing might use a salutation which signifies their profession.",Improve your English
"Doctors and academics who have a PhD sometimes use Dr, and college professors sometimes use Prof.",Improve your English
"Otherwise, you can use Dear Mr [surname] for a man, Dear Mrs [surname] for a married woman, or Dear Miss [surname] for an unmarried woman.",Improve your English
"If you do not know the marital status of a woman you are emailing professionally, you should use Ms [surname].",Improve your English

"It sounds particularly natural if you are just walking past someone who you relate to informally but do not have time for a long chat with, such as a postman, or a neighbor, or a cafe assistant.",Improve your English
"This said, it works just as well to start a longer conversation.This is a casual way of asking How are you?",Improve your English
People prefer to ask one of these questions after the main greeting.,Improve your English
