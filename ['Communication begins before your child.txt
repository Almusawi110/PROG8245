"There's no owner's manual or toll-free help line, just the weighty realization that you are on your own with the fragile little person whose car seat you can barely master.", "Now multiply that feeling by 100.That's the way Teresa and I felt after learning that Sam was deaf.", "We didn't know a thing about deafness or cochlear implants, but in the 9 months between Sam's diagnosis and surgery we committed ourselves to learn.", 'In the process, we empowered ourselves to make decisions with confidence as we navigated the maze of medical, bureaucratic, and practical issues that parents in our position must confront.We also sought to answer more personal questions.', 'For Teresa, there was a spiritual component.', 'While dedicating herself to reading books and identifying resources in our area, she also held out for a miracle.', "Meanwhile, I wanted to understand why some people in the deaf community, including one of my coworkers, were so against cochlear implants.Teresa is a stay-at-home mom who used our children's daily naptime as an opportunity to employ skills she developed as a former bank auditor.", "If someone at the county level couldn't answer a question about resources available to the deaf, she sought help at the state level.", 'If the state was slow, she contacted a politician.', "My wife's tenacity is the major reason we became so informed, and I will always be grateful to Teresa for charting our path.With a full-time job, I did less of the legwork.", "Still, I made sure my actions supported all of my wife's hard work and lessened the day-to-day stress related to it.", 'We participated in online seminars and watched videos together, and neither of us attended any of the roughly two dozen formal and informal appointments we made without the other.', "Teamwork made us stronger and more effective.One of the first lessons we learned was to be cautious about jumping on the Internet for quick answers before you know what you're dealing with.", 'We found ourselves worrying about rare, heartbreaking maladies that we ultimately learned Sam did not have.', 'The hospital proved to be a better place for answers.', 'We met with a surgeon the same week that we learned Sam was deaf.', "From there, the hospital loaned us hearing aids and set appointments for an eye exam, a CAT scan, an MRI, genetic screening, and other testing associated with the implant process.Teresa laid all the groundwork necessary for a teacher of the deaf from the state's Early Intervention program to start coming out to work with Sam on a weekly basis.", 'She also began what turned out to be a lengthy process to get Sam his own hearing aids through the state.The hearing aid trial period is a necessary step in the implant process.', "Given the severity of Sam's hearing loss, the aids didn't provide much benefit.", 'To Sam, they were little more than something handy to grab and chomp on.', 'But we persisted on the advice of a parent that we met.', 'Sam needs to grow accustomed to this sort of equipment, and thankfully his desire to remove and eat his hearing aids eventually subsided.The hospital gave us contact information for other families whose kids had gotten cochlear implants.', "Also, soon after Teresa contacted a state agency, we began receiving calls from people in New Jersey's Parent to Parent Program, a statewide network of parents supporting families of children with developmental delays, disabilities, and special health needs.", 'Having changed the batteries, gone to the therapy sessions, and watched their children blossom, families with real-life experience proved to be our greatest resource.', 'Just as there is a deaf community, there is a community of parents whose children have implants.People shared their stories and even welcomed us into their homes, filling us with hope.', "Through them, my wife and I realized that prayer, the blessed oil she applied to Sam's ears, and the trips to Saint Katharine Drexel's shrine would not result in Sam miraculously waking up one day as a hearing child.", "The cochlear implant would be Sam's miracle, and the kindness of other parents helped us see it that way.About 5 months into the process, we decided to pursue a second opinion at another, larger children's hospital.", 'I was reluctant to look elsewhere given the level of attention Sam received at the smaller hospital, where we ultimately stayed.', "While the second opinion didn't provide anything new from a medical perspective, I'm glad we went for it.The hospital staff invited us to a picnic for families of children with implants.", 'We mingled with parents, surgeons, audiologists and, most important, kids.', 'We got to see and speak with children whose abilities astonished us.', 'We also received firsthand reviews of a nearby school that specializes in kids with implants.We spoke to parents about sign language.', 'Teresa and I hesitated to pursue signing for fear that it could impede the verbal strides that we hope Sam will make after he receives the implant.', 'The parents calmed those concerns, inspiring us to use basic signs that, at 11 months, Sam is starting to try himself.', "It's incredibly gratifying to see Sam give his best effort on the sign for milk or smile and kick his legs with excitement when Teresa makes a sign for cookie.We're not the kind of people who are comfortable striking up conversations with strangers, but we've learned that being more outgoing can benefit Sam.", "Teresa befriended a young woman with an implant working in Walgreen's and learned that she's thriving in a local high school.", "After a call to a state senator's office went unreturned, I seized an opportunity to speak with him as he was waiting for his car at Jiffy-Lube, opening a relationship with someone who could someday serve as an important advocate for Sam's schooling.We tried to take any opportunity to learn that arose.", 'I didn\'t know what to think on my first day back at work when my deaf coworker wrote me a note that said: "I\'m jealous.', 'You and your wife are so lucky to have a deaf son."', "I couldn't begin to comprehend how someone could feel that way, so I accepted his subsequent invitation to learn more about the deaf world.He emailed me a list of upcoming events, including an all-deaf poker tournament about an hour's drive from my home.", 'On the Friday before the game, I told him I might attend, but failed to be definitive.', "The next day I felt compelled to go.My coworker, not expecting me to show up, wasn't there.", 'I was alone with perhaps60 deaf people in a room filled with gestures punctuated with sounds of slapping and laughter, but no words.', 'I felt very awkward as I struggled to communicate.', "After about 40 minutes, I found someone's hearing spouse, who volunteered to help me.Person after person at the poker tournament told me the implant was a bad idea, but their reasoning did not move me.", 'Their opposition seemed to be founded in dedication to the deaf community and in a strong belief that hearing loss is not an impediment.', "I understood and sincerely appreciated those positions, but the conversations didn't produce the most meaningful lesson of that day.I was welcomed into this corner of the deaf world with open arms, yet it was clear that I wasn't part of it.", "I imagined the isolation that I felt as I milled around the room as an outsider would be something Sam could face on a daily basis in the hearing world if we didn't give him the chance to gain the ability to listen and speak.",

later in life.To understand how and why hearing loss happens, it helps to know how the ear works.The ear is made up of three different parts: the outer ear, the middle ear, and the inner ear.', 'These parts work together so you can hear.', 'The outer ear, or pinna (the part you can see), picks up sound waves that then travel through the ear canal.When the sound waves hit the eardrum in the middle ear, the eardrum starts to vibrate.', 'When the eardrum vibrates, it moves three tiny bones in your ear.', 'These bones are called the hammer (or malleus), anvil (or incus), and stirrup (or stapes).', 'They help sound move along on its journey into the inner ear.The vibrations then travel to the cochlea, part of the inner ear.', 'The cochlea looks like a tiny snail shell.', 'It is filled with liquid and lined with tiny hairs.', 'The sound vibrations make the tiny hairs move.', 'There are two types of hair cells: the outer and inner cells.', 'The outer hair cells take the sound information, make it louder and tune it.', 'The inner hair cells change the sound waves into electrical signals.', 'The hearing nerve then sends the signals to the brain, letting you hear.There are a few different types of hearing loss:There are many reasons why a person may not be able to hear.', 'Hearing loss can run in some families, or a baby may be born with a problem with how the ear formed.', 'Other causes of hearing loss include:Ear infections and fluid behind the eardrum can cause hearing loss.', 'When the infection goes away, hearing gets better.Doctors can do hearing tests at regular checkups or any time there is a concern that a kid does not hear well.', 'The doctor will send a baby or child with hearing loss to an audiologist.', 'An audiologist (say: ah-dee-AHL-uh-jist) is someone who does hearing tests and helps people with hearing loss.The audiologist checks hearing by doing different types of tests.', 'They even have hearing tests for babies!', "Maybe you've already had a hearing test?", 'You probably wore headphones and had to raise your left or right hand to show that you could hear in each ear.The kind of treatment depends on the type of hearing loss, what caused it, and how bad it is.', 'Kids with permanent hearing loss are helped by audiologists; ear, nose, and throat (ENT) doctors; speech-language therapists; and teachers.Common treatments includeA cochlear (say: KO-klee-ur) implant is a tiny device that is put into the cochlea during an operation.', 'It takes over the job of the cochlea and sends electrical signals directly to the hearing nerve.', 'The sounds heard with cochlear implants are different from normal hearing.', 'With therapy and practice, all kids can learn what these sounds mean to better understand speech.A kid with hearing loss may go to a special school, special classes within a regular school, or be part of a regular classroom.', 'Kids with hearing loss may need hearing and speech therapy.Some people with hearing loss use special ways to communicate:What about talking on the phone?', 'There are phones that can make voices louder or a conversation can be typed out instead of spoken.', 'The messages appear on a screen.You might wonder how someone who cant hear see a movie or watch TV.', 'Closed-captioned TV shows and movies provide text at the bottom of the screen, so people with hearing loss can read along

slept.Limp lines crossed the computer screen for half an hour, and I got the sinking feeling the audiologist only continued to stare at them to avoid making eye contact with my wife and me.', 'She was preparing herself to share bad news.Only 3 months earlier, our second child, Sam, was born and we enjoyed one of the happiest days of our lives.', 'This day was one of the saddest.', "The fear that we both carried but largely avoided discussing was confirmed: Sam was deaf.Now, Sam is almost a year old and we're quickly approaching the day he will receive a cochlear implant.", "It's an exciting time for our family.", 'The pain we felt on the January morning when his hearing loss was confirmed faded as we learned about hearing loss and how the implant could help Sam navigate a hearing world.', 'Information has been our lifeblood, and we hope sharing our story benefits others who face similar situations.With no family history of hearing loss, my wife, Teresa, and I never considered the possibility that we might have a child who was deaf.', "And when Sam failed his newborn screening the day after he was born, the woman who performed the test told us inaccurate results were common.A month later, Sam failed another screening at our pediatrician's office.", "The audiologist explained that the parts of Sam's inner ear worked, but the equipment wasn't showing a response from the tiny hair cells inside his cochlea.", 'Leftover fluid from birth was the likely culprit, he said.Any explanation seemed reasonable because the idea that our son could have a significant hearing loss seemed so unreasonable.', 'Still, we were coming to grips with that reality.', 'Medical professionals, family, and friends all asked the same question: Does he respond to loud noises at home?', 'Each time we answered that question we were forced to be a little more honest with ourselves.Whether Teresa yelled his name from across the room or I clapped my hands just behind his head, Sam never budged.', 'We debated his blinks and gestures, but we were just being wishful.', 'That became clear at the third hearing screening, when the audiologist was noticeably somber.', "There were no new possible explanations to consider this time, just a recommendation that we make an appointment with a children's hospital for a more involved test.On January 9, we arrived at the hospital for an ABR (auditory brainstem response) test.", 'The audiologist escorted us from the waiting area to a dimly lit room filled with computer equipment and wires.', 'In a soft voice, she explained the test and told us it would take about an hour.', "It didn't.Her demeanor was a comfort as we settled in for the test, but as the test wore on we could read the growing disappointment in her face.", "Teresa was sobbing and I was choking back tears as the audiologist turned to us to explain the outcome.The test measured Sam's brain waves in response to sound at various volumes and pitches.", 'He showed no response.', "That means he never heard his mother's lullabies or his 2-year-old brother's laugh.", "In fact, based on the results, Sam wouldn't hear a freight train if he were close enough to feel the wind on his face as it rushed past.", 'The audiologist said it differently, but those were the harsh facts as I saw them.Teresa and I asked about everything from the finer points of the word "profound" to the reliability of the testing equipment, even though we knew better.', 'After a few minutes, the audiologist excused herself to give my wife and me time alone.', 'We held a tight embrace and cried.We had been through the common ups and downs of being new parents, but this was our first experience with full-fledged parental anguish.', 'We were wounded and helpless, afraid to leave the room.', 'Sorrow, guilt, and fear filled my mind as I thought about how ill-equipped we were to help Sam.', '"It\'s not fair," my wife said between bouts of tears.', 'She searched for answers where there were none: Was it the glass of champagne she drank before knowing she was pregnant?', 'Could it have been the cream the dermatologist prescribed for a rash?', 'Or was it the delivery itself?', 'To me, determining the cause seemed less important than figuring out what to do.What would we do?', 'Sam seemed like a different baby.', "We loved him just as much as before, but we weren't sure how to help him.", 'We hugged him, kissed him, put him back in his car seat and, with business cards, reading material, and videos in hand, began to make our way out of the hospital.We shed a lot of tears over the next few days as we told and retold the news.', 'We began meeting with various medical professionals almost immediately.', 'Family and friends called and visited, helping us get back into a normal rhythm.One

terms, I am partially deaf in both ears.", "I've lived for 17 years as a person with hearing aids in a mainstream world.", 'However, it has been a long journey to get to where I am today.When I was 2, I went off to my first day of preschool on a little yellow school bus.', 'Most kids my age were happily watching Sesame Street at home.', 'But because I had a hearing impairment, my parents felt that early intervention was the smartest option.', 'So I went to a school for the deaf for the first few years of my childhood.I did so well that the teachers decided to give me a new challenge: several classes a day in a regular public elementary school.', "I thrived there as well, and my parents and teachers felt that I was ready to mainstream (attend a regular school at my own grade level).My parents decided a private school might be best for me and they spent a lot of time interviewing different schools, looking for things that most parents wouldn't think twice about.", "For example, it was important that a school had carpeting rather than a tile floor so that sounds wouldn't echo and confuse me.I can still recall the day I met my new teacher.", 'She had big glasses and a shiny white smile and welcomed me with open arms.', 'She told me how excited she was for me to be in her class.', "At 4, I started kindergarten.I didn't really know I had a disability until I was at my new school and I saw all these kids without hearing aids and FM sets.", 'It was the first time I felt ashamed of my hearing impairment because I wasn\'t like everyone else.Whenever a classmate asked me about "the thing in my ear," I would get upset and run away.', 'My mother realized that I was having difficulty explaining this to the other kids and decided to do something about it.', 'She arranged to have a speaker come to my class and talk to the kids about hearing impairment.', 'I know that this helped kids understand because I eventually started making friends.', 'I think that they were just scared to talk to me because they were clueless about what a hearing aid was.', 'Maybe they thought I was an alien or something!It turned out my FM set helped the other kids, too.', 'The device, which I wore around my waist attached to two ear-mold cords, was linked to a wireless microphone my teachers wore.', 'One of my teachers would forget to turn her microphone off when she left the classroom.', 'Of course, we were rowdy when she left, but because I could still hear her, I was able to warn everyone when she was coming back.', "She'd find us all sitting in our chairs with our hands politely folded.", "That's probably why we were the only class that had an unusually high number of gold stars on the good behavior chart.", 'Not only that, I could hear everything the teacher said in the faculty lounge on the other side of school!', "I don't think that I told her about that minor detail until the end of the school year.Once I started middle school, I started feeling more and more self-conscious about having a hearing impairment.", "My FM set was no longer cool, and having speech-therapy sessions three times a week wasn't fun.", 'Because I had cleft palate when I was born, it was extra work to develop my speech skills.', 'I really felt that my classmates thought I was mentally impaired.', "I didn't like feeling different from them so I threw temper tantrums in front of my mom and dad until they finally let me wear only hearing aids and stop the speech-therapy sessions.", "I was so relieved that the speech therapy I'd been having my whole life was finally over.I've always been prone to ear infections and I got a really bad one in fourth grade.", 'The infection was bad enough to require hospitalization, but my parents felt that going to the hospital would be detrimental to my schooling.', 'So they had all the hospital supplies shipped to my house and my mom acted as my nurse.Because I needed intravenous antibiotics to treat the infection, I had an IV needle put in my arm at the hospital.', 'It was attached to a monitor that I wore around my waist.', 'It was about the size of a fanny pack and I absolutely despised it.', 'On top of feeling self-conscious in general, I now had to walk around with all this bulky equipment on my body.', "I was fortunate that my teachers and some of my classmates were sympathetic about my situation, otherwise I'd have had a really tough time emotionally.I've had about 15 operations on my ears since I was born, most of which have been tube replacements to help drain my ears.", 'It is kind of funny how close I am to some of the doctors and nurses in the surgical department at the hospital.', "It's similar to how people who play sports feel a bond with their coaches in my case, it's the doctors and nurses who are giving me tips and rallying me on.My most recent surgery was a tympanoplasty, which is a procedure to patch a hole in the tympanic membrane (eardrum).", 'My doctor patched the eardrum by taking a skin graft of the inside portion of my ear.', 'The moment I woke up from anesthesia I could hear my parents and the nurses without my hearing aid; it was a very joyous moment.', 'I can imagine that the happiness expressed on my face after the surgery was a truly rewarding sight for my doctor.Ironically, one of the side effects for me when I wake up from anesthesia is to cry.', 'After the tympanoplasty, my new hearing ability made it one of the strangest cries I ever had.', "Later that day at the dinner table, my dad took a napkin and covered his lips (so that I wouldn't read them) and said something.", 'I repeated it with confidence.The surgery also allowed me to go into water (shower, bath, and a pool) for the first time ever without earplugs.', "Earplugs were a problem for me, too, because I didn't like people staring at me whenever I was at the pool.Although I could hear better without my hearing aid after the tympanoplasty, the increase in volume was just enough for me to hear louder voices, but not whispers or quieter tones.", 'So I still rely on two other forms of communication: a hearing aid and lipreading.My hearing aid allows me to distinguish sounds from one another more clearly.', "And I've become really good at reading people's lips!", "It's a technique that I adopted at a very early age and will use for the rest of my life, regardless of my hearing capabilities.", "My friends can't get over how I can pretty much watch people have conversations across the room and absorb what they're saying.When I need to hear sounds other than conversations or be sure I hear every word that's said, I rely on my hearing aid.", "If I can't make a word out right away, I will go over the words that sound similar until something fits the context of the conversation.", 'I do this first before I ask the person to repeat what they say.', "Otherwise it'd be really frustrating to have a conversation with me.", "People often ask why I don't use two hearing aids and I honestly believe that my one hearing aid has enough power to compensate for the ear without the hearing aid.With new technology constantly evolving, I had an opportunity 3 years ago to replace my analog hearing aid with a digital one.", 'It was tricky learning to adjust to the new hearing aid because of the way my old hearing aid magnified every sound.', 'The digital hearing aid is quieter and required a whole month for me to get used to, but I absolutely love it.With my digital hearing aid, I have better quality sounds processing through my brain.', 'Once I was at a rock concert and my mom told me something in a loud voice and I replied back in my normal voice.', "I forgot that others can't hear the way I can!", "Of course my mom asked me to speak up about three times until she could hear me decently.I'm going to attend James Madison University in the fall, which is an exciting thing for me.", "I'll have a chance to be in an environment where I don't know everyone.", "This also means that I will have to explain my deafness to everyone that I meet, including my roommates.When I know I'll be in a new environment, I like to wear my hair down so that it covers my hearing aid.", 'This way I know that people will treat me like any other person and not judge me before they talk to me.', "Don't get me wrong, I have much more confidence than when I was in middle school.", "I don't have any problems talking about my hearing impairment, and in fact, I would much rather have people ask me questions than talk about it behind my back.I've already started to prepare for college by getting an alarm clock that vibrates under my pillow.", "This way I'll be respectful of my roommates, but I still worry about what I'll do in some situations, like when a roommate forgets her room key.", 'Will I hear her knock?', "It's all a matter of adjusting independently to a new way of life.I often wonder about the things that the future will bring and if there will be a time in my lifetime where I will be able to hear normally.", "In the meantime, I live every day to its fullest and take nothing for granted.Reviewed by: Robert C.

signing is describing the visuals that the illustrations are providing (such as the children snug in bed i n the Santa story) and then ask the child to make further guesses (perhaps about the loops of

story, and then about whats going to happen in their home on the next holiday, and then about whatever else they want.', 'That is, interaction may be minimal or it may be prolonged and complex.', 'So long as both parent and child are enjoying themselves, repeated sharings of the ebooks will almost assuredly result in improved signing skills for both, and in increased language interaction over the books, which cannot help but develop better understanding of narrative and characterization.', 'That is, we hope that these unscripted and joyful SRAs will be as fruitful for the emergent deaf reader

T. Raising kids who read : what parents and teachers can do.', "San Francisco: Jossey -Bass/Wiley, 2015. frontiersin Children's literature provides the opportunity for children to see both representations of themselves and of others in print and in pictures.", 'Not only can engaging with picture books develop key literacy and language skills and a love of reading, but reading (and/or being read) high quality books also has the potential to foster an appreciation and respect for oneself and others.', 'However, sometimes the diversity that exists in the real world is not represented wellor at allin books created for young children (Mendoza and Reese, 2001; Kama, 2004).', "In this article we will discuss the lack of, and critical need for, children's books that portray Deaf1 characters from a cultural perspective.", "We will also provide examples, from a sampling of children's picture books, of messages about deafness and deaf characters in text and illustrations (e.g., Golos and Moses, 2011; Golos et al., 2012).", 'Finally, we will highlight the implications for both hearing and d/Deaf children as well as parents and educators.Typically, when people think about deafness, they think about a person with a disability, that is, someone who is unable to do something (i.e., hear).', 'This represents a pathological perspective of deafness, which entails viewing deafness as a disability or as a condition that needs to be fixed with medical intervention (i.e., cochlear implants or hearing aids; e.g., Lane, 1992; Lane et al., 1996; Padden and Humphries, 2006).', 'Deaf studies scholars suggest an alternative view of deafness from a cultural perspective, in which the deaf person is seen a member of a minority population, the Deaf community, rich with their own language (i.e., American Sign Language or ASL) and culture (i.e., Deaf culture) (e.g., Lane et al., 1996).Prior to 1990, when researchers examined portrayal of characters with disabilities in media, deafness, similar to other disabilities, was stereotyped as a person, needing to be fixed, isolated, angry, in danger, and/or unable to function in daily life (e.g., Carlisle, 1998).', 'It has only been recently that some have begun to compare portrayals of deafness for pathological vs. cultural perspectives.', 'Although there has been an increasing awareness of Deaf culture, evidence from empirical studies suggests that the pathological perspective prevails (Golos, 2010; Golos and Moses, 2011; Golos et al., 2012).', "For example, we content analyzed the text and illustrations of 20 children's picture books published after 1990 and that included a main character who was deaf (Golos and Moses, 2011; Golos et al., 2012).", 'Results showed that the majority of messages related a pathological perspective of deafness (71% of messages in the text and 93% of the messages in the illustrations).Because of the prevalence of messages reflecting the pathological model of deafness, young readers may be more likely to experience books about deaf characters attending public schools and being mainstreamed with hearing children, as well as struggles they may face in such settings.', "For example, more often they may learn about characters like Oliver who cannot hear and, as a result, is isolated until he receives his hearing aid (Riski and Klakow, 2001).Although cultural portrayals exist in children's literature, characters like Oliver dominate the literature.", "We found that the most common pathologically-oriented messages included references to fixing the character's deafness and having a greater ability to function or an improved quality of life after receiving amplification (e.g., hearing aid or cochlear implant) (Golos and Moses, 2011; Golos et al., 2012).Another recurring message involved the deaf child in danger.", 'For example, in one picture book, there is concern that a deaf character might get hit by a car because the character could not hear (Roth, 2000).', 'In another story, an elementary-aged deaf child gets upset and runs into an elevator, does not know how to use it and gets stuck.', 'Other characters are concerned because the boy cannot hear their verbal instructions (Watkins, 1993).', 'Similar to the disability literature, these, and other similar messages found in the sample, perpetuate a stereotype of a deaf child as needing to be fixed or needing help to function in everyday situations (Carlisle, 1998; Golos and Moses, 2011; Golos et al., 2012).Although the sample was small, there were very few cultural messages found in the text and illustrations of the 20 picture books analyzed.', 'One of the few examples comes from the Moses series, in which the deaf character, Moses, attends a school for the deaf and everyone signs (including his family).', 'When his mother asks Moses how his first day of school was he responds, I have 10 classmates and all ten are my friends (Millman, 2000, p. 27).', 'Additional examples included aspects of the Deaf community (e.g., attending a Deaf theater production), or Deaf characters using flashing lights, and other cultural technologies used in everyday situations (i.e., without medical intervention) (e.g., Millman, 2000; Tildes, 2006).However, it should be noted that books conveying more of a pathological perspective also contained some positive messages.', 'For example, some books included messages related to positive relationships between the deaf child and his/her parent(s).', 'In Moonbird (Dunbar, 2007), the parents learn the importance of communication and valuing their deaf child for who he is, and in Dad and Me in the Morning (Larkin, 1994), a hearing father and his deaf child bond while watching the sunrise.', 'Moments such as these represent the critical connection between family members and their deaf child.One reason the pathological perspective dominates may be due to an increase in medical technology, such as cochlear implants.', 'As a result, deaf children are increasingly mainstreamed into general education settings or placed in self-contained classrooms.', 'However, in these settings, a deaf child often has limited interactions with other deaf children and/or Deaf adults, may not be taught or encouraged to use ASL and the classrooms often lack staff and/or resources to teach about Deaf culture.Recent evidence suggests that deaf children, regardless of use of amplification, benefit from exposure to visual language such as ASL (e.g., Mayberry, 2007, 2010) and exposure to culturally Deaf role models (e.g., Holcomb, 1997).', 'Deaf community members and national organizations for the Deaf (http://www.nad.org/issues/education/k-12/position-statement-schools-deaf) support schools for the deaf that offer access to ASL and Deaf culture as the preferred setting for most deaf children.', 'However, for the increasing number of children not attending these schools, there may be a greater need for positive Deaf role models and positive messages about ASL.', "Utilizing children's picture books is one way to do so.", 'They also can offer the hearing population messages to promote understanding and respect for d/Deaf people.', "However, to do so, they must contain accurate information about the Deaf community and Deaf culture.Ultimately, picture books could have considerable impact on children's perceptions of themselves and others.", 'If hearing children read (or are read) picture books that present a pathological view, they may learn that deafness is a disability, that a deaf person struggles in daily life, and that medical fixes are necessary in order for a deaf person to be happy, able to function, and be accepted.', 'For the Deaf child, such depictions may cultivate a sense of inadequacy and/or low sense of self regarding who they are and what they can do.', 'She/he may also feel the need to be fixed.If, on the other hand, picture books portray a cultural perspective of Deaf people, then deaf and hearing children could learn that Deaf culture exists and thrives and learn more about the language, history and values that are distinct from the hearing population.', "Through exposure and discussion about picture book messages, the hearing population could even serve as advocates for preserving the Deaf child's language and culture.", 'Deaf readers may see that, like the main character in the Moses series, they can go to a school where Deaf teachers use sign language (e.g., ASL) and can learn to enjoy the arts, athletics, and academics utilizing their strengths in a visual language (e.g., ASL) and in a visual environment.', 'This may promote a feeling of pride and help develop a strong sense of self.Too often, being different from the majority is depicted negatively.', 'Deaf studies scholars have coined the term Deaf Gain as a way of looking at the Deaf community from a perspective of benefit rather than loss (Bauman and Murray, 2009).', 'That is, viewing deaf individuals as providing a unique to contribution to his/her community and broader society.', 'Most notable are the visual ways of being (Bahan, 2009), including communicating through a visual language (e.g., ASL) and designing visual environments (lots of light, seats arranged in a way that everyone can see one another, etc.', ").To help promote the concept of Deaf Gain in children's picture books, we encourage parents and teachers to incorporate books with cultural messages into their classrooms, and discuss these cultural messages.", 'Recent examples, in addition to the Moses series, include new eBooks from Deaf authors/illustrators such as the Zoey Goes series.', 'According to their website, the goal of their eBooks is for deaf children to see themselves and for hearing children to learn about a linguistic minority (zoeygoes.com).', 'Parents and teachers can capitalize on these messages by discussing with children (hearing or deaf) how deaf people benefit from and access visual ways of being, such as using a light to get their dogs attention instead of calling him.', 'However, there remains a need for high quality literature that incorporates more of these types of messages.When pathological messages are present, educators should take the time to discuss them.', 'For example, after reading the book about the deaf boy who gets stuck in the elevator, adults might ask children if they think that situation is realistic.', 'Or, they might present examples of how all children can use visual strategies (that deaf individuals use) to do things, such as cross the street.', "Finally, children can learn that all deaf children, regardless of their use of medical technology or background can have friends, have skills and talents to share with others, and can lead meaningful lives.As an area for future research, we suggest that children's picture books be examined for their quality.", "After examining some of the storylines and themes of children's picture books with deaf characters, one might question whether these stories would have been published if the characters were not deaf.", 'For instance, would a story be published about an elementary-aged hearing child who did not know how to use an elevator?', 'Although an empirical examination is needed to examine the quality of current literature, teachers should review storylines and messages in books before choosing to incorporate them in their classrooms.', "The ultimate goal is to choose books that are worthy of children's time and attention that help develop their early literacy skills, and that provide important and accurate information about diverse populations.Children's picture books hold the promise to promote awareness and appreciation.", 'Yet in order to do this, diverse populations should be depicted positively and accurately.', 'Picture books can portray Deaf Gain through images, fictional stories, biographies and other genres that portray the unique qualities and advantages of visual ways of being rather than the loss of hearing.', 'However, even when alternate messages are present these topics should still be discussed with children so they develop an awareness and appreciation in hearing readers as well as pride and connection to Deaf culture and the Deaf Community in d/Deaf readers.Just as our own favorite picture book from childhood stays with us through the years, so may the other characters and messages portrayed in picture books that display diverse people and diverse ways of being.', 'Picture books have the potential to influence our thoughts, perceptions and identity, and choosing and discussing picture books for young children provides daily opportunities to inspire and enlighten.', 'Ideally, books chosen for children should foster these positive outcomes creating both an immediate and lasting positive impression of themselves and others.', 'Bahan, B.', 'Sensory orientation.', 'Deaf Stud.',

Andrews & Mason, 1986 ; Freel et al., 2011 ), we conclude this line of reasoning with a challenge to develop fault tolerant approaches that explore, permit, and encourage multiple pathways for all deaf readers to become successful.', 'These paths tend to challenge and avoid bottom-up drill as the most efficacious strategy for learning to read.Overall, classroom observations and research on deaf readers find that even young deaf children, with limited proficiencies in both American Sign Language (ASL) and English, when learning to read take advantage of signing and fingerspelling ( Andrews & Mason, 1986 ; Andrews, 2012 ).', 'These findings are in contrast to traditional approaches to early reading instruction and frameworks that have been designed for deaf students.', 'The proposed alternative frameworks involve visual language, including ASL, printed texts, and visual processing.', 'Visual processing strategies focus on visual learning, where learning is processed through the eye and can include visual engagement strategies such as visual attention, gaze behaviors, visual joint attention (see reviews in Baker, 2011 ; Hirshorn, 2011 ; Lieberman, Hatrak, & Mayberry, 2011 ), as well as the use of pictures, illustration, drawings, print, movies, and visual media ( Kuntze, Golos, & Enns, 2014 ).2.', 'The Big PictureDespite decades of teaching and research, the basic process of how deaf children transform print into thought without full access to language is not fully understood (see Marschark & Everhart (1997) for a treatise on the relation between language and thought).', 'Like the Cupples et al.', '(2014) perspective, some researchers believe that comprehending the auditory phonological structure of words ( Geers & Hayes, 2011 ; Luckner, Sebald, Cooney, Young, & Muir, 2005 ; Trezek & Mayer, 2015 ; Paul, Wang, Trezek, & Luckner, 2009 ) is a key factor in deaf childrens early literacy difficulties.', 'This approach has gained momentum and has been applied to early literacy learning as more deaf and hard of hearing children have access to the phonology of English with cochlear implants or digital hearing aids (see for example, Johnson & Goswami, 2010 ; Montag, AuBuchon, Pisoni, & Kronenberger, 2014 ).', 'However, Mayberry, del Giudice and Lieberman (2011) counter-argue that language, not phonological awareness, is the key variable to reading for deaf students.', 'They provided a meta-analysis of studies that showed that phonological awareness accounted for 11% of the variance, with a greater percentage of the variance being explained by reading comprehension.', 'Importantly, 35% of the variance was explained by overall language proficiency.', 'Similarly, Geers and Hayes (2011) noted that deaf children with CIs had higher performance on more global literacy measures than on phonological processing tasks, suggesting to them that visual processing strategies provided alternative routes to reading.', 'Moreover, Clark, Gilbert and Anderson (2011) found the phonological awareness was not related to reading skills; some participants had near perfect phonology and weak reading skills while others were reading at the post-secondary levels with almost no phonological skills.', 'Given this findings as well as other published work (e.g., Freel et al., 2011 ; Miller & Clark, 2011 ), we do not fully understand whether phonological skills are acquired after the development of reading skills, in contrast to the idea that phonological skills are precursors to becoming a skilled reader.What we do know is that compared to hearing children, it takes deaf children longer to learn to read, often three to four years and sometimes even longer ( Hoffmeister & Caldwell-Harris, 2014 ), with many youth plateauing at the fourth grade level even after nine or more years of education ( Traxler, 2000 ).', 'Such low reading achievement levels are found worldwide with deaf children learning to read both alphabetic and logographic scripts ( Liu, Liu, & Andrews, 2014 ; Qi & Mitchell, 2011 ; Wang, Paul, & Lee, 2010 ).', 'We also know that many deaf children do learn to read early, particularly those who have deaf parents ( Lieberman, Hatrak, & Mayberry, 2011 ; Herbold, 2008 ).', 'The aspects of reading that we do understand are related to observable factors such as the demographic characteristics of deaf children, including their early access to spoken and sign languages, as well as supportive parents.', 'Still there is ample documentation on the challenges deaf children face with the linguistic features of texts at the word, phrase, clause, sentences, and discourse levels ( Paul & Wang, 2012 ).2.1.', 'Reading Difficulties for Deaf ChildrenAs deaf children progress in school, they often have difficulty with comprehending morphemes ( Nielsen, Luetke, & Stryker, 2011 ), and acquiring and comprehending vocabulary (particularly multiple meaning words (see reviews in Paul et al., 2009 ).', 'In addition, there are problems in comprehension including; figurative language ( Rittenhouse & Stearns, 1990 ), verb particles ( Payne & Quigley, 1987 ), syntax ( Kelly, 1996 ) and accessing world knowledge ( Convertino et al., 2014 ).', 'Importantly, as these types of linguistic and cognitive structures are often the foundation of childrens books, the problems make reading complicated for these deaf children.', 'For example, Sugiura (2012) used Family Circle comic strips to test elementary aged deaf childrens reading skills.', 'These children were reading below the second grade level and were found to have difficulty understanding the meaning of punctuation marks, such as quotation marks in dialogue, verb contractions, ellipses, and exclamation marks.', 'These types of findings highlight the cognitive, grammatical and reading fluency difficulties typical of many deaf readers.There are several other issues that often are problematic in deaf childrens reading development.', 'Effective eye gaze synchrony ( Clark et al., 2015 ), the development of joint attention strategies ( Lieberman et al., 2011 ), and parent/child storybook reading ( Andrews & Zmijewski, 1997 ; Berke, 2013 ; Lartz, 1999 ) are often missing in hearing families that are not using a visual language.', 'These issues mentioned above often limit parent involvement in literacy activities in the home.', 'These gaps in early interactions between a child and their parents with print and books can therefore delay and limit literacy outcomes ( Andrews & Mason, 1986 ; Andrews & Zmijewski, 1997 ; Bailes, Erting, Erting, & Thumann-Prezioso, 2009 ; Berke, 2013 ; Watson & Swanwick, 2008 ; Williams, 2004 ).', 'All of these cognitive and linguistic developmental issues create problems for many deaf children as they learn to read.2.2.', 'Factors That Impact Literacy and Deaf ChildrenThe key factor for deaf childs reading is early and full language access, whether the language is auditory or visual, ( Goldin-Meadow & Mayberry, 2001 ; Mayberry, Lock, & Kazmi, 2002 ; Mayberry et al., 2011 ; Pnicaud et al., 2013 ).', 'Limiting the deaf child to only auditory pathways for language learning is risky, even with newer auditory technologies, such as digital hearing aids and cochlear implants, as they may not provide full access to auditory language.', 'Therefore, these children need exposure to language models in both visual and auditory modalities from the time hearing loss is detected, to take full advantage of the sensitive period for language learning (see reviews in Humphries et al., 2014 ; Kuhl & Rivera-Gaxiola, 2008 ; Kushalnagar et al., 2010 ).ASL is a natural language, which has all the properties of spoken languages, with fundamentally different linguistic and grammatical structures ( Andrews, Leigh, & Weiner, 2004 ).', 'Moreover, ASL occurs in a different modality (Traxler, 2012).', 'Despite these differences, the brain does not differentiate between signed languages or spoken languages and children acquire either, or both, if the languages are provided in the environment ( Petitto, 2009 ; Petitto et al., 2012 ).', 'Given that 95% of all deaf children are born to hearing parents, access to visual language is often not provided ( Andrews, Leigh, & Weiner, 2004 ).', 'This choice of only presenting spoken language to a deaf child may not provide sufficient linguistic input to allow typical cortical development ( Pnicaud et al., 2013 ) or the acquisition of typical linguistic milestones (Andrews, Logan, & Phelan, 2008).', 'Recent research on bimodal bilingual children (those who had exposure to both spoken and sign languages) with cochlear implants found that exposure to early sign language lead to increases in spoken language skills when compared to cochlear implant children without sign exposure (Hassanzadel, 2012).2.3.', 'Reading Models for Deaf ChildrenCurriculums developed to teach hearing children to read have been used to teach deaf children to read and most of them focus on auditory phonology.', 'Stanovich (2000) focuses on reading problems related to phonological sensitivity in hearing individuals.', 'His theory is used in the Qualitative Similarity Hypothesis (see Paul, Wang, & Williams, 2013).', 'The Simple View of Reading emphasizes both decoding and comprehension to explain reading difficulties ( Gough & Tunmer, 1986 ); these ideas can be seen for deaf readers in Easterbrooks et al.', '(2015) .', 'Others have utilized Masons top-down model, which underscores the importance of reading whole stories to preliterate children to help them make connections to early reading ( Mason, 1980 ) and is found in the work of Andrews and her colleagues ( Andrews, 2012 ; Andrews & Mason, 1986 ; Andrews, Winograd, & Deville, 1994 ).', 'Still others focus on the bilingual acquisition of ASL and English ( Allen, Letteri, Choi, & Dang, 2014 ; Hoffmeister & Caldwell-Harris, 2014 ; Kuntz, Golos, & Enns, 2014 ; McQuarrie & Parrila, 2014 ; Supalla, Wix, & McKee, 2001 ) rather than applying traditional reading models developed for hearing children.', 'These theoretical perspectives are expanded below.2.4.', 'Qualitative Similarity HypothesisA view articulated by Paul (2013) , as well as Trezek and Mayer (2015) , labeled the Qualitative Similarity Hypotheses (QSH), is that deaf children go through the same process as their hearing peers in learning to read, even if they are delayed in their reading milestones.', 'Here, visual and auditory tools developed by educators for hearing children are added to provide deaf children access to auditory phonemic awareness and the alphabetic principle ( Paul & Wang, 2012 ).', 'One augmentative technique is speech reading, but only 30% of English phonemes can be visually distinguished on the lips ( Andrews et al., 2004 ) making the technique ineffective for full comprehension.', 'Another tool is that of the use of articulatory feedback ( Seifert et al., 2002 ), which is also limited by the amount of speech the child can hear, with or without cochlear implants and/or digital hearing aids.', 'To overcome these limitations, Cued Speech was developed ( Cornett, 1967 ) and consists of eight hand shapes or cues (representing consonants) at four different locations around the mouth (representing vowel sounds).', 'These cues and mouth positions are used in combination with residual hearing and the visual information from speech reading to make the phonemes of English visible to the deaf child.', 'A more recent system, called Visual Phonics (International Communication Learning Institute, 1996), is being used in deaf education and consists of 46 manual representations or hand gestures, with the 45 written symbols that correspond to the 45 phonemes of English, with a 46th hand gesture used to indicate the silent e. Each mouth movement is paired with a hand gesture to represent a single phoneme of English ( Paul & Wang, 2012 ).', 'These visual markings are hypothesized to make English phonology available to deaf children, and allow them to develop reading skills in similar ways to their hearing peers, but often at a delayed rate.Easterbrooks and her colleagues ( Easterbrooks et al., 2015 ) also believe that auditory phonological awareness is important and follow the Simple View of Reading (SVR) ( Gough & Tunmer, 1986 ), which emphasizes that decoding skills and oral language development are needed for reading to take place.', 'Here the use of fingerspelling was included in the model, but only in relationship to mapping onto the letters of the alphabet.In sum, the QSH researchers ( Easterbrooks et al., 2015 ; LaSasso & Crain, 2015 ; Paul, 2013 ; Trezek & Mayer, 2015 ) collectively suggest that both language-related and auditory code-related skills are needed for reading development.', 'Each propose that proficiency in face-to-face communication of the target language (English), including its phonological aspects (whether presented auditorily or visually) are critical for the literacy development of deaf children.2.5.', 'Visual Language Learning & Mapping Sign/Fingerspelling to PrintPattern recognition of the smallest units of language is a skill that all language learners must learn, whether these be auditory sounds or units that are represented visually and tactilely through speechreading, articulatory feedback, Visual Phonics, Cued Speech, signs, fingerspelling or written letters (Andrews & Wang, 2015).', 'In contrast to the above researchers who focus on auditory phonology, some researchers connect meaning to print by using visual phonology and sign orthography.', 'This strategy goes directly from print to meaning ( Allen et al., 2014 ).', 'Here visual phonology (or alternative visually based ASL phonology or visual sign phonology) is the mechanism used to learn to read.', 'This visual segmentation provides the prosodic and suprasegmental structure of signs, signed sentences, fingerspelling, and the orthographic patterns of letters.', 'Allen (2015) studied 251 deaf children, ages 3 to 7 who had severe to profound hearing losses, examining the impact of early visual language on early literacy, cognition, and social adjustment.', 'He found that when fingerspelling skills were controlled for, ASL showed an independent effect on letter knowledge.', 'Here, ASL skills were interpreted as being derived from a visually based phonological process that transfers to the learning of letters and an orthographically based system of sub-lexical units that can combine to form words and can occur independently of letter-sound knowledge as well as fingerspelling.', 'Therefore, both ASL receptive skills and fingerspelling skills were strongly and independently related to childrens alphabetic knowledge (see Figure 1).', 'Allen and colleagues concluded that readingFigure 1.', 'Path model showing impacts of age, ASL Receptive Skill, and Fingerspelling Skill on letter knowledge using a say or sign task.can be qualitatively similar to hearing children, if it is presented in forms that are modality independent, i.e., visually ( Allen et al., 2014: p. 355 ).', 'In addition Allen et al.', '(2015) found that among the three, four, and five years old within their database who had parents who used ASL, these children had the highest levels of letter knowledge.', 'This effect to a lesser extent was also found with children whose parents were only beginning to learn to sign.', 'Children whose parents used only spoken language had the lowest levels on pre-literacy measures.Another model based on visual language and visual learning is called the Functional Equivalency Model ( McQuarrie & Parilla, 2014 ).', 'This model asserts that there are some aspects of reading for deaf people that are similar to that of hearing readers.', 'However, their work suggests that deaf readers crack the orthographic code in fundamentally different ways than do their hearing peers.', 'Their findings show that deaf readers were insensitive to the auditory phonological structure of words at the syllabic, rhyming, and phonemic levels.', 'Similar to the model proposed by Allen et al.', '(2014) , these authors concluded that factors of sign language and print orthography contribute to the reading processes of deaf children, and replace auditory phonology.Related to the visual nature of the models of Allen et al.', '(2014) and McQuarrie and Parilla (2014) , other work shows that visual pattern recognition of larger chunks of letters is also important.', 'For example, deaf children who learn the print letter patterns of morphemes, which are highly regular, use these patterns as another visual learning strategy when learning to read ( Nunes & Bryant, 2006 ).', 'They used materials based on morpheme teaching, linking their work to that with hearing children.', 'Numes and Bryants participants, after given morpheme instruction, had significantly higher understanding of using suffixes in spelling, word reading, reading comprehension and writing skills.', 'Similar findings by Nielsen, Luetke, and Stryker (2011) show the importance of morphemic awareness for supporting reading development for deaf children.2.6.', 'Three-Stage Descriptive Model Hoffmeister and Caldwell-Harris (2014) propose another model grounded in visual language and visual learning.', 'In their model, deaf children can become skilled readers, through reading and writing of English print.', 'They state that the phonology of English is not necessary.', 'The authors emphasize that is it not deafness per se that causes reading difficulties, but a lack of full access to a visual language.', 'This lack of access to visual language causes the inherent difficulties deaf children have in acquiring language when they cannot practice it outside of the school activities of reading and writing.', 'In this model, there are three stages of learning that represent successive, conceptual insights for deaf children learning their second language (English) through print.', 'In the first stage of learning to read, deaf children learn how to map translations of familiar signs and sign phrases to print at the word and phrase level.', 'In stage 2, the children progress to mapping signs to words and sentences, including idioms, metaphors, and multiple meanings.', 'Then in stage 3, children use their bilingualism to learn additional English, through print in a bilingual, interactive learning mode ( Hoffmeister & Caldwell-Harris, 2014 ).', 'In this way, a strong foundation in sign language is used as the bridge to becoming bilingual in both sign and a later developed spoken language.2.7.', 'Whole to Part (Top down) ApproachRather than starting at the word/phrase level as proposed by Hoffmeister and Caldwell-Harris (2014) or focusing on letter knowledge as one indicator of emergent literacy ( Allen et al., 2014 ), a whole-to-part or top down model developed for hearing children was proposed by Mason and her colleagues ( Mason, Stewart, Peterman, & Dunning, 1992 ; McCormick & Mason, 1989, 1990 ) and was adapted for signing deaf children.', 'This model can explain reading picture phrase books ( Andrews & Mason, 1986 ), reading expository science texts ( Andrews & Mason, 1991 ) as well as reading fables using ASL summaries ( Andrews, Winograd, & Deville, 1994 ).', 'According to Mason and her colleagues, childrens earliest concepts about print and books are developed from their earliest experiences and interactions with storybook reading, environmental print and writing, as well as their own attempts to read, write, and make meanings from social interactions.', 'Early reading encompasses the awareness and experiences with reading, writing, speaking, listening and thinking, all of which occurred in the home prior to children starting the formal instruction of conventional literacy in the first grade.', 'This view of reading is not only historical, but is still relevant today as researchers studying deaf children continue to use these emergent literacy frameworks ( Herbold, 2008 ; see reviews in Trezek & Mayer, 2015 ; Williams, 2004 ).', 'These recent works show that signing deaf children by age five can identify environmental print, write their names, fingerspell their names, write most, if not all, of the alphabet, and recite back elements of storybooks after being read to ( Herbold, 2008 ; Williams, 2004 ).', 'This framework includes four components, listed and explained below.1) Concepts and functions of literacy include knowledge of terms that are used to talk about reading.', 'Here understanding the functions of print, knowing how the act of reading is carried out (i.e.', 'knowing where to begin, and how to continue reading by turning pages), how to separate speech into words, syllables, and letters become the foundations of literacy.', 'Then, being able to track a line of print and ones self-perceptions about reading are important components of becoming a reader.', 'Finally, context-sensitive strategies for word reading and knowledge of environment print in familiar contexts allow the child to become literate.', 'These functions are top-down and provide the big picture about reading.2) Knowledge of letters and words functions as the bottom-up support for becoming literate.', 'This knowledge includes letter knowledge, phonological awareness of beginning and ending sounds in words, grapheme- phoneme correspondence knowledge, and word recognition of common words and words containing generalizable patterns.3) Listening comprehension and word understanding again brings in whole-to-part strategies and includes complete or partial retelling of stories, defining, classifying, drawing analogies to words, and developing multiple strategies for reading texts.4) Writing and composing moves into the written forms of literacy, focusing on word writing, sentence dictation, and story composition.Here even though word identification and word decoding are important, the point being made is that early reading is more comprehensive than phonological awareness and vocabulary.', 'By extension to deaf children, early reading does not start at the one sign to one word mapping event, but can be initiated when a whole story or passage is presented in easy-to-read books with pictures, through signing conversations children have with adults, or with short passages of texts.Using a top-down reading model, as these studies suggest, is supported by research ( Supalla, Hauser, & Bavelier, 2014 ) in the short-term memory processes of deaf children and deaf adults who are fluent signers.', 'On a recall task using ASL sentences, fluent signers (both children and adults) used top-down scaffolding in their working memory to retrieve the meaning of the ASL sentences.', 'In contrast, deaf signers who were not fluent in sign used more linear strategies and visuospatial memory to imitate signed words.', 'Additionally, they recalled lexical signs in linear order and omitted function words.', 'Given these findings, Andrews and her colleagues suggest that to focus on early reading at the word-sign mapping or fingerspelling/decoding process is to miss the larger picture of what real readers dothe reading of complete texts, whether they are language experience stories, simple easy-to-read picture books, or more complex texts.2.8.', 'The Five-Component ModelAnother model is based on visual language and visual learning; the theoretical underpinning is based on the literature about multiliteracies and the sociocultural view of literacy ( Kuntze, Golos, & Enns, 2014 ).', 'This model is an alternative pathway, as reading comprehension is not only based on language acquisition and emergent literacy skills, but also learning a new language (ASL) as part of this process.', 'This early reading model includes five components: ASL acquisition and visual engagement, emergent literacy, social mediation with English print, literacy and Deaf culture, and finally multimedia activities.', 'It also includes the use of indigenous practices by deaf parents within their signing families; these interactions socialize deaf children into becoming readers ( Kuntze et al., 2014 ).', 'Their model suggests that the signing deaf children acquire reading through the visual modality, without access to spoken language, and that reading instruction should reflect these visual ways of learning.2.9.', 'ASL Sign WritingThe last model that uses visual language is one that develops reading instruction by having deaf children learn to read ASL graphemes and ASL glosses.', 'Glossing is a written notation system devised to represent ASL ( Supalla & Cripps, 2011 ).', 'In the first stages children learn to match pictures of objects with pictures of manual signs.', 'Then deaf children are taught a new writing system, which uses graphemes that represent the visual phonology of signs, including their hand shape, movement and location.', 'In the third stage, children are taught to read English glosses for ASL signs, which is called ASL glossing.', 'Supalla and colleagues use ASL gloss as an intermediary writing system, which links the childs ASL to English print.', 'There is an ASL Resource book, with gloss text written in what the authors call the ASL-phablet.', 'The ASL graphemes are written in a linear string to create sign equivalents of English words ( Supalla et al., 2001 ; Supalla & Cripps, 2011 ).2.10.', 'SummaryThese visual perspectives are noteworthy because they focus on the language of the Deaf community to bridge meaning to English print without the use of English auditory phonology.', 'Moreover, reading instruction for English here involves using the linguistic structure of ASL to bridge meaning from one language to the other.', 'Not yet available is a strong science base to determine if these top-down models for deaf children are a promising avenue for learning to read.', 'So far these visual models suggest that there is more involved in learning to read than only bottom up strategies based on spoken language teaching curriculums.We do not dispute the fact that hearing loss exists along a continuum.', 'Ninety-five percent of deaf children have hearing parents.', 'Many deaf children have some residual hearing, which permits access to auditory process- ing strategies and other auditory cognitive processing strategies to comprehend print, especially if they have cochlear implants or digital hearing aids ( Marschark et al., 2015 ).', 'However, in view of the documented delay of the language and early literacy of young deaf children using auditory methods to teach reading ( Cupples et al., 2014 ), we think that alternative approaches using signs and fingerspelling are warranted, given the accumulating data showing the early sign language acquisition facilitates the development of early reading ( Allen, 2015 ; Clark et al., 2016 ; Freel et al., 2011 ; Mayberry et al., 2011 ; Pnicaud et al., 2013 ).As such, the five visual frameworks we present are united in that they suggest that all deaf children can be bilingual, where both ASL and fingerspelling can be used to become literate in English.', 'Furthermore, they support the notion that the rhythmic and statistical regularities of ASL and fingerspelling have a facilitating role, in that it gives deaf children another tool, visual phonology, to use as a bridge to the learning of English ( Kuhl & Rivero-Gaxiola, 2008 ; Mayberry et al., 2011 ).2.11.', 'Suggestions for an Alternative ParadigmThese five deafcentric frameworks focus on the visual language of ASL and visual learning, as well as the use of Deaf cultural role models in the teaching of reading.', 'These models warrant consideration in future research because too many deaf childrens academic success has not improved for decades ( Johnson, Liddell, & Erting, 1989 ; Qi & Mitchell, 2011 ).', 'Creating a Fault Tolerant System in the schools and home, as proposed by Treisman (1992, 2013) , therefore, would be worth trying.In developing his ideas, Treisman (1992) was attempting to reverse the failure of African American students in STEM fields (especially calculus) at Berkley.', 'Treiman wanted to understand why different environments lead to success while others lead to failure.', 'He suggests we focus on environments that create Fault Tolerant Systems, where individuals are able to absorb problems and overcome them, rather than succumb to them.', 'These systems promote resiliency and allow community cultural wealth ( Yosso, 2005 ) to protect those from underrepresented groups to succeed.', 'If one looks at this kind of cultural capital, one finds strategies that are taught outside of the dominant culture to permit success.Deaf capital wealth includes using a visual language, visual learning, and successful Deaf adult role modelsleading to aspirational capital, which serves as a protective factor in the face of lower expectations from hearing members of the society ( Twitchell, Morford, & Hauser, 2015 ).', 'Some researchers have already incorporated visual language, visual learning and Deaf cultural role models, as in the five models discussed above, and others include visual language in the teaching of early reading ( Humphries, 2004 ; Humphries et al., 2014 ).Can the Triesman model lead us to a new perspective related to deaf children and their literacy and language development?', 'As we know young deaf children are experiencing the same overall levels of failure ( Allen, 1986 ; Marschark & Harris, 1996 ; Musselman, 2000 ) as those African American students who were Treismans focus.', 'What might Treisman have to contribute to this evolution in deaf education from the current model to a fault tolerant system?', 'Treisman (1992) states that there are unequal opportunities to learn and therefore, one needs to develop magic bullet interventions where people can suspend belief about failure.', 'We can create expectations and positive mindsets to allow us to instill survival skills.', 'We need to design educational environments where we search for those who are not well served and understand the factors that prohibit self-efficaciousness in families, teachers, and students.', 'One must have a universally connected system of support for it to be fault tolerant ( Treisman, 2013 ).', 'Here early interventions with deaf infants, as well as effective deaf education, qualify as a system that would benefit from a re-design.Parents could create another system; this system would include a deaf infant whose parents were taught how to develop and maintain eye gaze with their infant to develop strong attachment and reciprocal turn-taking ( Clark et al., 2015 ).', 'Turn-taking is crucial as it underlies both social and language development and sets the stage for future learning between teachers and students.', 'Applying this model, medical and early intervention professionals would strongly suspect that these hearing parents would be unaware of how their own attention getting devices would not be effective with their deaf and hard of hearing infant.', 'Their goals would be for parents and their infant to have a strong start and learn how to regulate attention for later social-emotional, linguistic, and future learning interactions.', 'The focus might be on attention, rather than focusing on discussing a choice between signed or spoken language.', 'The goal for this discussion would be to be sure that parents had a mechanism that allowed them to develop strong caregiver-infant bonds.', 'The parents and child could later decide on the best strategies for language choice, school choice, and how to have strong peer relationships for their deaf and hard of hearing child.Medical professionals, audiologists, early childhood educators, schools, and families, would work to be sure that the deaf and hard of hearing child was developing according to well-known linguistic, social-emotional, behavioral, and academic milestones.', 'The focus would be on visual language; i.e., being sure to allow the child to look for language, regardless if it was spoken or signed ( Clark et al., 2015 ).', 'This system would monitor the childs ongoing development, based on evidence-based practices in developmental psychology.', 'The system would be sure to provide all options to the family and the deaf and hard of hearing child, including research about how early signing with cochlear implants does not negatively impact spoken language development ( Hassanzadeh, 2012 ; Lyness, Woll, Campbell, & Cardin, 2013 ).', 'These professionals would recommend the best of all hearing technologies, language possibilities, and all possible educational options.', 'The societal system would place the deaf and hard of hearing child in an environment that embraced differences and established a cultural perspective that focused on diversity and how all can contribute to the success of our world.2.12.', 'Personal ReflectionsAs a bilingual team of two hearing and two deaf authors, we have experienced alternative outcomes, following the developmental model of Triemsan, proposed above.', 'Kim Misener Dunn, one of our collaborators, who is Deaf, commented on how her early home and preschool experiences, most notably parent home conversations and early book reading had a profound impact on my vocabulary development.', 'She elaborated below:My preschool teacher encouraged my parents and siblings to read me books with printed sign language.', 'Because of my early access to a visual literacy environment, I was reading when I entered kindergarten at age four.', 'I used print labeling in the home and sign language to teach my hearing daughter how to read, and it was successful.Beth Hamilton, our second collaborator, who is Deaf, had a different family system than Kim Misener Dunn and was exposed to signed vocabulary at age 3 1/2 years.', 'She was born prelingually and profoundly deaf.', 'Beth Hamilton emphasized the importance of early signing and sibling support.I started formal school at age 3 1/2, and my vocabulary and language thrived.', 'I remembered how I first learned to read in kindergarten when my teacher connected ASL-story telling, picture and words.', 'Now that I have a deaf preschool daughter, I use the same strategies with her.It is evident that we see systems that were aware of appropriate language development.', 'The larger societal systems provided alternative strategies to allow effective development of cognitive academic language proficiency (CALP) ( Cummins, 1979 ).', 'When the environments were adapted for visual learners, this change permitted both deaf authors to succeed academically and enter doctoral level programs to improve the educational systems of other deaf children.3.', 'ConclusionIf we consider early reading and deaf children within the context of the development of the whole child, we can see that they need a strong language base for communication, thinking, and learning.', 'Speech skills are not sufficient.', 'Visual communication, such as signing could support the development of the childrens delayed speech.', 'Clearly, the environment must be assessed to determine if it is supporting the childs needs.', 'The model would emphasize that a deaf hearing status is simply a difference and not a deficit.', 'Models of deficiency should be replaced with developmental models that monitor the development of executive functioning, linguistic development, and socio-emotional development, which will become the foundations for later academic learning and success.', 'Many young deaf children of hearing parents ( Karchmer & Mitchell, 2003 ) from non-signing homes have not yet developed BICS, or basic interpersonal communication skills ( Cummins, 1979 ), leaving them without the linguistic foundation to enter school and build CALP.', 'Developmental monitoring to evaluate known linguistic milestones could have sent up warning flags that would have allowed modifications of early interventions to prevent or reduce these multi-year linguistic delays.Given the continuing failure of our deaf educational system for many deaf children, if we analyze the systems involved in this result, we would expect much higher levels of performance given recent research in bimodal/ bilingual and bilingual language approaches for deaf children ( Allen, 2015 ; Mayberry & Eichen, 1991 ; Mayberry et al., 2002 ; Petitto, 2009 ; Petitto & Marentette, 1991 ; Petitto et al., 2012 ).', 'Given the language and literacy delays typically noted in the literature, it appears to be time to consider a paradigm shift in the sense of Kuhn (2012) .', 'This suggestion is not to reject hearing technologies, nor reject the phonological orientation.', 'Auditory phonological training may be of use to the deaf child in conjunction with other strategies at different times during their reading instructional lives, particularly after a solid language base has been established visually.', 'The visual language orientation is more comprehensive and can provide young deaf infants with an early bimodal/ bilingual or bilingual intervention.', 'This type of intervention can maximize both their access to spoken as well as visual language for a more effective outcome by age five; the time at which most children enter kindergarten to learn more about reading.', 'Given the evidence of multiple pathways for learning to read, our Fault Tolerant System would closely monitor ongoing developmental trajectories and modify and adapt language environments and educational systems as needed.This Fault Tolerant System would embrace several philosophies.', 'First, it would use critical pedagogy as the baseline for linguistic and academic success; failure would be attributed to ineffective systems and not to deficits in deaf children.', 'Next, the Fault Tolerant System would adjust ecological niches to allow for multiple pathways to linguistic development and academic success.', 'Finally, deaf and hearing partnerships would be the norm in all research, policy, and educational decision-making situations.', 'Since Unlocking the Curriculum ( Johnson et al., 1989 ), deaf education has failed to modify the academic success for the majority of deaf children and has not eliminated the cycle of low expectation often found in our medical and educational systems.', 'The 12 principles found in the work of Johnson et al.', 'in conjunction with more recent work on bimodal bilingualism ( Nussbaum, Scott, & Simms, 2012 ) in combination with these suggestions for a Fault Tolerant System, just MAY improve deaf education.', 'What do we have to lose: a large percentage of another generation of deaf children, which is not acceptable.NOTES*Corresponding author.1The use of
